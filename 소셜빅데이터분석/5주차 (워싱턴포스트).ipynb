Wolfensohn, the urbane investment banker who helped right the finances of major U.S. cultural institutions, including Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center, then focused a life’s experience in politics and finance on remaking the World Bank during a tumultuous decade as its president, died Nov. 25 at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe Institute for Advanced Study, a theoretical research institute in Princeton, N.J., where Mr. Wolfensohn was a past board chairman, announced the death. His son, Adam Wolfensohn, said the cause was complications from pneumonia.Mr. Wolfensohn was often characterized as a modern Renaissance man, as comfortable with the top figures of the arts world as he was with global business leaders and politicians. He was a native Australian who was an Olympic fencer in his youth. A classical music aficionado since his teens, he began cello lessons as an adult from the ailing star Jacqueline Du Pre.ADADIn what he referred to in a Forbes interview as “a totally egocentric affair,” beginning at age 50 he would gather top musician friends at Carnegie Hall to join him for once-a-decade birthday concerts.A onetime air-conditioning salesman, Mr. Wolfensohn climbed the world of high finance and joined the ranks of the global elite at the bond-trading house of Salomon Bros.  in New York. At Salomon he was put in charge of advising Chrysler as it edged toward bankruptcy in the late 1970s, adding to the sense of economic malaise that, along with the oil embargoes and war in the Middle East, rattled the presidency of Jimmy Carter.Helping arrange what was then the largest-ever corporate bailout in U.S. history, Mr. Wolfensohn was put in weekly contact with top officials such as Paul A. Volcker, then chairman of the Federal Reserve — further lengthening his list of contacts. He also proved his ability to work across borders, smoothing over a cultural rift between combustible Chrysler chief Lee Iacocca and the Japanese bankers who had  lent the Detroit auto company $600 million.ADADAfter receiving $10 million when Salomon was sold, Mr. Wolfensohn started his own boutique consulting firm and gradually built a client list that included companies as diverse as Mercedes-Benz and Ralph Lauren.But it was his work at the World Bank that defined his public life. After a middle-class upbringing in Australia, he wrote, early trips to India and Nigeria as an air-conditioning salesman had left “an indelible mark.”“The inequity was so striking that I could hardly absorb what was in front of me,” he wrote in his 2010 memoir, “A Global Life.” “I had known what to expect intellectually but the reality was a shock.”Changing the culture  at the World BankAs a result, even as he built a global career in finance, he trained his sights on the World Bank presidency. He even acquired U.S. citizenship to qualify for the job — under an unwritten rule it is the U.S. president’s job to fill — and put his “golden Rolodex” to work lobbying President Bill Clinton when the position opened up in 1995 after the death of Lewis T. Preston, a former president of JPMorgan Chase.ADADMr. Wolfensohn took over an institution besieged from both sides of the political spectrum. From the left, anti-globalization groups slammed the bank as little more than an extension of U.S. foreign policy, pressing private-sector economics and fiscal restraint on developing nations and ignoring local environmental and cultural concerns in the construction of large infrastructure projects. From the right, the World Bank was seen as an inefficient source of handouts to poorly performing countries.Mr. Wolfensohn did not quickly endear himself to an organization that one of his former staffers likened to a “big battleship,” constrained by its own inertia.He was apt to break into tears on trips to World Bank work sites in remote villages. He famously said the aim of the organization — a massive and staid bureaucracy — was to “put a smile on a child’s face.”ADADThat comment made him seem a naif to bank staff more acclimated to the organization’s technocratic approach to economic development. Combined with a temper honed on Wall Street and often trained on those who had dissatisfied him, it meant a rocky transition from the private sector to an organization that thrived on international politesse. Mr. Wolfensohn was apt to holler at staff and was quick with threats of firing.He also shattered some taboos — most notably the willingness within the bank to accept corruption as part of the cost of doing business in some parts of the world.“When I arrived at the bank, I was told, ‘You don't talk about the C-word because it is a political issue. The bank is owned by governments, and your charter does not allow you to enter into the political field,’ ” Mr. Wolfensohn said in a 1999 speech in South Africa.ADADAmong his first speeches as bank president was a landmark address on “the cancer of corruption,” in which he made the case that such practices were quite literally taking money away from the poor.Mr. Wolfensohn’s work on corruption has endured. The bank now regularly debars firms and cancels projects when it finds that payoffs or bribes have been involved.Wolfensohn biographer Sebastian Mallaby, in his book “The World’s Banker,” credits him with one other important change to the bank’s culture: focusing it more on the priorities of the developing countries that are borrowing the money and carrying out the work.Partly in response to complaints from nongovernmental groups that felt the bank staff was heavy-handed in its demands, Mr. Wolfensohn pushed the organization to ensure that local governments and civic groups had influence over what the bank approved and how it carried out its work.ADADTop staff were encouraged to move from the headquarters in Washington to field offices. A new lexicon developed within the organization as projects were vetted more closely for environmental effects, larger projects that often disrupted villages fell into disfavor, and local priorities became more important.The changes had a downside, according to critics who felt the organization by necessity became more bureaucratic and that its “safeguards” added time to an already lengthy project-approval process.But Mr. Wolfensohn’s basic insight was sound.“He was a relationship banker,” Mallaby said. “Wolfensohn turned the bank in that direction” by focusing on developing countries as clients to be courted and served, not pupils to be lectured. Mallaby said that Mr. Wolfensohn’s central point, credited with improving results on the ground, was that “it didn’t matter if a development project made sense if the country did not want to do it.”ADADHe was adept at managing as well. Over strong misgivings among leaders of the developed world, he pushed through debt relief for the poorest nations. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he pressed the case that development had to be part of the response — drawing a link between poverty, failed states and terrorism.The bank’s work in places such as Afghanistan expanded, the administration of President George W. Bush boosted foreign aid and  widespread chatter of Mr. Wolfensohn’s likely ouster fell silent.When he left the bank job in 2005, he had been invited into a former lion’s den — the annual meeting of Greenpeace — to give a keynote address, the World Bank’s main headquarters atrium was named in his honor and Bush tapped him to serve as the special envoy to the “quartet” of major nations then pursuing an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.Early days in finance and fencingJames David Wolfensohn was born in Sydney on Dec. 1, 1933. His parents, Hyman Wolfensohn and the former Dora Weinbaum, had emigrated from London a few years earlier looking for economic opportunities.ADADHyman Wolfensohn, known as Bill, had spent years as a personal secretary to banking scion James de Rothschild — the future World Bank president was named in Rothschild’s honor — and hoped his experience and connections would let him launch his own career.He didn’t do well. In his autobiography, his son said his childhood was clouded by family tension over finances, a fact that shaped his approach to people. His father often avoided those who Mr. Wolfensohn later came to suspect were creditors. Even as a boy, he said, he developed a habit of studying any social setting to pick out potential allies and adversaries — a skill in “reading the room” that helped him in business.From his mother, who sang on Australian radio and gave her son piano lessons, he developed a love of music. He was unabashed enough to take on female roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas in high school and was an avid symphony fan.As a young man, Mr. Wolfensohn did not display any particular talents for academic success. He nearly flunked out of the University of Sydney, and one of his first investments was lost to a scam-artist “inventor.” His successes seemed to come not through natural genius but through intense application.Given a chance to join the university fencing team, for example, he practiced hard enough to gain a spot on the Australian Olympic squad. He won two of his bouts at the 1956 Melbourne Games but lost a third because of what he called a mental mistake described in “A Global Life.” His opponent distracted him during a break in the match with a party invitation and promises of an introduction to an Israeli swimmer.The Olympic training in fencing helped hone his sense of strategy. “Fencing is a little like chess,” Mr. Wolfensohn wrote. “You must project a few moves ahead and outthink your opponent.”If Hyman Wolfensohn’s highbrow connections were only of limited help to himself, they were gold in the hands of his son. An early mentor and family friend, Australian jurist Julius Stone, helped James get an internship at a top Sydney law firm and admission to Harvard Business School — positions that Mr. Wolfensohn allowed he would not have gotten on the strength of his academic credentials alone. (He received the Harvard degree in 1959 after having earlier graduated from the University of Melbourne’s law school.)While in Boston, he met Wellesley student Elaine Botwinick, whom he would later wed. His wife died in August. In addition to his son, of Brooklyn, survivors include two daughters, Sara Wolfensohn Mayle of Cambridge, Mass., and Naomi Wolfensohn of Long Island City, N.Y.; and seven grandchildren.After the stint selling air conditioners in Africa and Asia, he returned to Australia for jobs at different investment houses before graduating to the financial firms of London and New York.Restoring cultural landmarksBeginning as a dealmaker at investment banking firms such as Schroders in London, he moved in 1977 to Salomon in New York. He ensconced himself in New York’s cultural firmament, befriending people such as conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein.In 1980, Mr. Wolfensohn became chairman of Carnegie Hall and, after contributing $1 million, raised $60 million from his friends to renovate the venerable performance space. During his decade as chairman, he was credited with stabilizing the institution’s finances.In 1990 he was recruited to do the same for the Kennedy Center, suffering at the time from the sort of budget shortfalls that had beset Carnegie. In his memoir, he referred to the institution as a “white elephant,” with outdated equipment, a leaky roof, cracking granite and a hidebound approach to programming.He pushed crowd-pleasing programs — productions such as Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Cats” and “The Phantom of the Opera” — to fill the seats and lobbied Congress for a boost in funding. His ideas, particularly about programming, clashed with some of the center’s longtime employees and, according to news reports at the time, prompted longtime artistic director Marta Istomin to resign in 1990.During his five years guiding the Kennedy Center, he was said to have restored the physical building and the center’s finances, even if he fell short of some of his larger aspirations. At the time, he was criticized for dividing his time too thinly between his work in Washington, his private investment firm and other undertakings.Mr. Wolfensohn, who received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in 1995 for his contribution to the arts, served on corporate and charitable boards.He admitted to an inability to prioritize, turn down an invitation or reject a request to serve on such boards. Colleagues at the World Bank noted that they would load him down with reading, only to see him disappear into his office and spend the next hours on the phone.“What can I tell you? You get drawn into things,” he once told an interviewer. “Everything is interesting.”\\nRead more Washington Post obituaries]</td>\n",

Subscribe today.arrow-rightYet Mr. Jordan was, for years, one of the most influential figures in Washington. With a commanding presence, personal charm and an inviolable sense of discretion, he had a rare combination of talents that made him the confidant of presidents, congressional leaders, business executives and civil rights figures.Mr. Jordan was the consummate Washington power broker, reaching the peak of his quiet authority during the 1990s, when he was, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton’s closest adviser. He had Clinton’s ear through two terms as president, including the most challenging moments, when Clinton faced an investigation and impeachment for a relationship with a White House intern.ADAD“The last thing he’d ever do is betray a friendship,” Clinton said in 1996. “It’s good to have a friend like that.”Mr. Jordan died March 1 at his home in Washington. He was 85. The death was confirmed by his daughter, Vickee Jordan. She declined to state the cause.Mr. Jordan brought a smooth manner and elegant style to Beltway dealmaking, anchored in his youth in a housing project in the segregated South. He had the moral authority of a veteran of the civil rights movement — he nearly died in a 1980 shooting by a racially motivated would-be ­assassin — and was adept at navigating corporate boardrooms and golf course fairways, as well as gospel-filled churches.ADEarlier generations of Washington insiders had given advice from the sidelines, including Tommy “the Cork” Corcoran, Bryce Harlow, Clark Clifford, Lloyd Cutler and Robert Strauss — Mr. Jordan’s mentor at the Akin Gump law firm. But one significant way in which Mr. Jordan differed from his predecessors was he was among the few African Americans at the top of Washington’s power structure.ADIt was a role he had cultivated for decades. As early as 1971, when he became executive director of the National Urban League, Mr. Jordan outlined an approach to bring the civil rights struggle to the highest levels of government and business.“Black power will remain just a shout and a cry,” he said then, “unless it is channeled into a constructive effort to bring about Black political power and to influence the established institutions of American politics.”Instead of marching in the streets, Mr. Jordan marched toward the executive suite. He persuaded corporate leaders to hire Black workers and support institutions — most notably the Urban League — that benefited African Americans. By the time Mr. Jordan came to Washington in 1981, his influence could be felt from Wall Street to Congress to the grass roots of the civil rights movement.ADAD“I’m not a creature of the boardrooms,” he told People magazine that year. “I’ve got relatives on welfare. I’m a creature of the first public housing project for Blacks ever built in America,” in his native Atlanta.Photos: Jordan’s careerMr. Jordan was once under consideration to be commissioner of the National Football League and was rumored as a possible attorney general or ambassador to Britain. But he never accepted a nomination for any position that would require Senate confirmation.He sat on the boards of more than a dozen companies, vacationed on Martha’s Vineyard and wore custom-made shirts from Savile Row. For years, he spent Christmas Eve with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and presidents and billionaires attended his parties.ADYet the ways in which Mr. Jordan wielded his power remained something of a mystery. He had a magnetic quality, which Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) described to Vanity Fair as a “personality that seduces men and women differently, but nevertheless seduces.”ADMr. Jordan seldom left an official paper trail. People asked to discuss his clout in the capital often kept silent or sought his permission before responding.“He learned what it was to be the quintessential insider. He was sort of a fixer,” Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley said in an interview. “I don’t think he was feared as much as he was a custodian of Washington gossip. He had an accumulation of dirt that could be used as a wedge against an opponent.”ADMr. Jordan made his presence felt in phone calls and cloakroom whispers, in casual clubhouse conversations and across the luncheon table. IBM sought Mr. Jordan’s advice when it needed a new chief executive; he set the wheels in motion for James Wolfensohn to be named president of the World Bank; he recommended people for jobs ranging from summer intern to secretary of state.ADMr. Jordan had an affability and charm — and a sometimes intimidating 6-foot-4 physique — that put him at ease in any situation. He was often the only Black person in the room. He was a Democrat, but he counted many Republicans among his friends.“He has the ability and capacity to pick up the telephone almost any time and call almost any member of Congress, especially on the Democratic side of the aisle,” Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said in 1992, when Mr. Jordan was co-chairman of Bill Clinton’s presidential transition team.He cultivated political figures on the rise, long before they acquired a national profile. Mr. Jordan first met Hillary Clinton in 1969, the year she graduated from college, and Bill Clinton in 1973, when he returned to Arkansas from law school at Yale. He met Barack Obama when the future president was a state senator in Illinois.ADADHe and Bill Clinton had a particularly warm rapport, with a shared Southern heritage and an interest in golf. Mr. Jordan was among the first to suggest Sen. Al Gore (D-Tenn.) as Clinton’s running mate in 1992. After Clinton was elected, Mr. Jordan vetted candidates for Cabinet positions and the White House staff. When he later visited those officials, he always brought flowers for their administrative assistants.“I have seen Vernon — too many times to count — help not just young people but any people,” Strauss told The Washington Post in 1998. “There are individuals in this country leading corporations and financial institutions and laboring in the vineyards because Vernon has been there to help and to make a few phone calls for them. That’s why people respect him.”One topic often whispered about away from Mr. Jordan’s presence was what a 1992 Post profile called his “reputation as a lady-killer” — which he declined to discuss, except to say, “I like all kinds of people. And I’m not going to stop liking people.”ADADTo Clinton, Mr. Jordan was a sounding board in good times and bad. He consoled the president after the 1993 suicide of deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster and after Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was killed in a plane crash in 1996.The relationship between the president and his counselor faced its most severe test in 1998, when Clinton was being investigated for an alleged relationship with White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky. Mr. Jordan reportedly arranged to hire a lawyer for Lewinsky and find her a job with Revlon, one of the companies of which he was a board member. (The job offer was rescinded amid the turmoil.)Mr. Jordan made five appearances before a grand jury during the independent counsel investigation of Clinton led by Kenneth W. Starr. He answered questions during a House inquiry that led to Clinton’s impeachment.ADADAs Republican opponents accused Mr. Jordan of conspiring with Clinton to obstruct justice, he did not lose his composure. He never discussed the scandal in public, even after Clinton was acquitted by the Senate.Mr. Jordan was so closely identified with Clinton that, as he later told the Los Angeles Times, “People look at me and believe that I was born January 20, 1993,” the day Clinton took office as president. “That is not true. My life was defined long before that.”'Vernon can read'Vernon Eulion Jordan Jr. was born Aug. 15, 1935, in Atlanta. His father was a postal worker on a military base.Mr. Jordan attended segregated schools, but he also was exposed to Atlanta’s elite White society while working for his mother’s successful catering business. At her urging, he left the South for college, attending DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind. He organized voter registration drives for Black residents of the region and became prominent in campus government and oratory.During his summer breaks, he returned to Atlanta, working as a chauffeur and waiter for an aging Robert F. Maddox, who had been the city’s mayor from 1909 to 1911. Mr. Jordan sometimes read the books in Maddox’s voluminous library, prompting a rebuke from his boss.Even after Mr. Jordan received permission to use the library, the former mayor told his family at dinner that he had an announcement to make: “Vernon can read.” Mr. Jordan never forgot the incident and used the backhanded comment as the title of his 2001 memoir.After graduating in 1957 from DePauw, where he was the only Black member of his class, Mr. Jordan entered law school at Howard University in Washington. He graduated in 1960, then joined an Atlanta firm led by a prominent African American lawyer, Donald L. Hollowell.The firm sued the University of Georgia on behalf of Charlayne Hunter, who became one of the college’s first two Black undergraduates in 1961. Mr. Jordan escorted her to class through jeering crowds.Soon afterward, Mr. Jordan became Georgia’s field secretary for the NAACP and led boycotts of stores that refused to hire Black workers. He moved to Arkansas in 1964 and coordinated voter registration efforts that added 2 million Black voters to rolls across the South.By 1969, Mr. Jordan was a fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, and the next year, he became executive director of the United Negro College Fund. When Whitney M. Young Jr., executive director of the National Urban League, drowned on a visit to Nigeria in 1971, Mr. Jordan was chosen as his successor.He oversaw a budget of $100 million and traveled extensively to raise money from corporate leaders to support job training, early-childhood education and other programs aimed at improving Black life in the United States. He joined the boards of blue-chip companies including American Express, Xerox, Dow Jones &amp;amp; Co., Union Carbide and RJR Nabisco, and used his access to executives to encourage major companies to hire women and members of minority groups.Early on the morning of May 29, 1980, after addressing an Urban League gathering, Mr. Jordan was shot in the back with a high-powered rifle after exiting a car in a parking lot in Fort Wayne, Ind. He was rushed to a hospital, where doctors managed to close a wound the size of a fist. Mr. Jordan noted that the surgeon, the internist and the anesthesiologist who treated him in Fort Wayne were African American.“Now what that suggests,” he said, “is that there has been some progress.”President Jimmy Carter and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) went to Fort Wayne to see Mr. Jordan. After he was transferred to a hospital in New York, he was visited by Ronald Reagan, then a Republican presidential candidate, and a host of corporate titans as well as religious and civil rights leaders.Indiana authorities arrested Joseph Paul Franklin in connection with the shooting. Franklin had a history of racial violence, including shooting at mixed-race couples. (Mr. Jordan had stepped out of a car driven by a White woman.)At trial, Franklin was found not guilty of violating Mr. Jordan’s civil rights.Years later, Franklin confessed to the attack on Mr. Jordan and to an earlier shooting in 1978 that left Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt paralyzed. After having been convicted of eight and linked to as many as 20 killings nationwide, Franklin was executed in Missouri in 2013.D.C. eminenceDuring his 98-day hospitalization, Mr. Jordan reassessed his life. With the Urban League facing a chilly political climate with the incoming Reagan administration in 1981, Mr. Jordan moved to Washington as a senior partner with Akin Gump.He was sometimes described as a “superlawyer,” but his role at the law firm and lobbying shop resisted easy definition. He was not a registered lobbyist and did not argue cases in court.“If you ever see me in the library here, tap me on the shoulder,” he reportedly told a colleague. “For you will know that I am lost.”As the Clinton presidency was coming to an end in 2000, Mr. Jordan took a senior position at the New York investment banking firm of Lazard Frères, for a reported salary of $5 million a year.He retained his position at Akin Gump — “I’m there every Friday,” he said — and continued to be a presence in Washington.Mr. Jordan’s first wife, the former Shirley Yarbrough, died of multiple sclerosis in 1985, after 26 years of marriage. The next year, he married Ann Dibble Cook, a onetime professor of social work at the University of Chicago. In addition to his wife, of Washington, survivors include a daughter from his first marriage, Vickee Jordan of Washington; three stepchildren, Toni Cook Bush of Washington, Janice Cook Roberts and Mercer Cook, both of New York; and two grandsons.During the 2008 presidential election, he supported Hillary Clinton over Obama, saying, “I’m too old to trade friendship for race.”Yet Obama joined Mr. Jordan on the golf course and clearly recognized his eminence. Each year, as business moguls and political luminaries descended on Washington for the annual dinner of the Alfalfa Club, there was one invitation that was even more exclusive: brunch at Mr. Jordan’s house. Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos (Amazon founder and owner of The Post) and congressional leaders were likely to be there, rubbing elbows and sampling the omelets.Even when Obama skipped the Alfalfa Club’s white-tie dinner, he made time to show up at Mr. Jordan’s brunch.\\nRead more Washington Post obituaries]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[with Brent D. GriffithsJerome H. Powell has spent months all but skywriting over the Capitol that lawmakers should provide more emergency economic relief.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightNow, with Congress moving forward with a roughly $900 billion aid package and the vaccines that should eventually end the coronavirus pandemic rolling out across the country, the Federal Reserve chair has an updated message: This is no time for Washington to ease up.“Getting through the next four, five, six months, that is key,” Powell said at a news conference after the central bank’s last policy meeting of the year. “Clearly, there’s going to be a need for help there. And, you know, my sense and hope is that we’ll be getting that.”Powell, in circumscribed Fed-speak, emphasized that the work the Fed and Congress need to do to repair the economic wreckage from the pandemic won’t be done even once the vast majority of the population is inoculated.ADAD“We’re going to need to continue to provide support to this economy for quite a period of time,” he said, adding that although the economy “should be growing at a fairly healthy clip by the second half of next year, it’s going to be a while” before the labor market returns to the condition it was in at the beginning of this year.From RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas: For the central bank’s part, that means it will keep buying government debt and mortgage bonds until “substantial further progress has been made” toward a full recovery, the Fed said in updating its guidance. And most of its policymakers project the Fed will keep its benchmark interest rate near zero through at least 2023. The moves are aimed at encouraging economic activity by keeping borrowing costs low for individuals and businesses.ADADAnd as lawmakers self-impose a cap on their latest round of relief, Powell made clear strong investor appetite for government debt is giving Congress plenty of room to keep spending. Viewed through the lens of low real interest payments on the debt, “we're actually on a more sustainable fiscal path,” Powell said. It's a point some top economists have been emphasizing. From former top Obama economic adviser Jason Furman: Some economists faulted the Fed for not going even further. For example, the central bank for now has decided against shifting its asset purchases to longer-term bonds, which would further depress long-term interest rates. In a note, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson called it a “real missed opportunity.”ADAnd Powell declined to weigh in on the future of lending facilities it launched this year at the direction of the Cares Act. They are expiring, and it will fall in part on the incoming Biden administration to determine whether they should continue.Powell’s presentation reflects a balancing act.The Fed is wrapping up a year defined by the worst economic crisis in a century. In the near-term, a stalling recovery looks primed to deteriorate further. “November marked the slowest month of job growth since the spring, with the unemployment rate ticking down slightly from 6.9 to 6.7 percent,” Rachel Siegel notes. “Retail sales fell last month. Millions of Americans are behind on rent and utility bills, and nearly 8 million Americans have fallen into poverty since the summer.”ADADYet the economy has also bounced back faster than most forecasters expected. And the central bank now sees a brighter picture unfolding next year than it anticipated just months ago. Per Rachel, “In their latest round of economic predictions since September, Fed leaders predict that unemployment will fall to 5 percent by the end of next year, and 4.2 by the end of 2022. Officials also showed a more hopeful outlook for GDP. In September, Fed leaders projected that GDP would grow 4 percent by the end of 2021 but revised those estimates to suggest growth of 4.2 percent.”From former Treasury Department economist Ernie Tedeschi: The course of the pandemic will determine how the economy gets back on the road to recovery. Powell noted that economists’ projections to date have overestimated the havoc the crisis would wreak. He said the current spike in coronavirus infections “is so much larger” than what the country has seen so far that it is already registering in the economy, “particularly activity that involved people getting together in bars and restaurants, on airplanes, and hotels,” and other in-person commerce.Powell wouldn’t offer specific recommendations about the size or composition of the congressional relief package. Following Republican demands, for example, the emerging compromise on Capitol Hill leaves out direct aid to state and local governments. The Fed chair said that decision “is entirely in the hands of Congress.”ADADBut he did spell out the stakes, noting that budget shortfalls have forced state and local governments to lay off 1.3 million people since the start of the pandemic in March. That’s “a very large number of people to be out of work from just that one source,” he said — more than lost their jobs in the global financial crisis. “It’s a concern,” he said. Coronavirus falloutPresident-elect Joe Biden on Dec. 16 called the roughly $900 billion coronavirus aid bill taking shape in Congress a \"downpayment\" toward a bigger stimulus. (The Washington Post)Congressional leaders near agreement on aid package.The compromise includes a second round of stimulus checks. “The package emerging is expected to include hundreds of billions of dollars in aid for ailing small businesses and jobless Americans; tens of billions of dollars in aid for other critical needs, such as vaccine distribution and schools; and a one-time check of between $600 and $700 for millions of Americans below a certain income threshold,” Jeff Stein, Mike DeBonis and Seung Min Kim report.ADAD\"The relief bill is likely to be coupled with several other major legislative efforts — from legislation to fund federal agencies to a bipartisan effort to rein in surprise medical billing — that lawmakers could then pass into law in a matter of days.”The package includes $300 in enhanced jobless benefits. And, per my colleagues, “Democrats also secured $25 billion to establish a new program to provide emergency rental assistance, funding that could be used to cover past and future rent payments, as well as other related expenses.”Tensions are flaring as negotiations wrap up. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) got into a heated exchange on a Democratic conference call over Sanders’s demand for stimulus checks more generous than $600. “Manchin has said unemployment benefits are more essential to approve and helped spearhead a bipartisan compromise that Sanders has derided as insufficient.”President-elect Biden is embracing the deal. “The stimulus package is encouraging. It looks like it’s very, very close,” he said Wednesday. “It’s a down payment. An important down payment that’s going to have to be done. … It’s very important to get done.”The timing is tight. Per my colleagues: “Even if negotiators reach a deal Wednesday, clearing it through Congress by the Friday midnight deadline could be difficult. The House could vote as soon as Thursday, waiving its usual three-day rule for the review of legislation. The Senate would then have to secure unanimous consent among its 100 members to skip procedural hurdles and move to a final vote before the deadline. An objection from Sanders or any other senator could cause a brief government shutdown unless lawmakers agree to another short-term funding bill.”America’s biggest companies soared during the pandemic.They still laid off thousands of workers: “With few exceptions, big businesses are having a very different year from most of the country. Between April and September, one of the most tumultuous economic stretches in modern history, 45 of the 50 most valuable publicly traded U.S. companies turned a profit, a Washington Post analysis found,” Douglas MacMillan, Peter Whoriskey and Jonathan O’Connell report.AD“Despite their success, at least 27 of the 50 largest firms held layoffs this year, collectively cutting more than 100,000 workers, The Post found. The data reveals a split screen inside many big companies this year. On one side, corporate leaders are touting their success and casting themselves as leaders on the road to economic recovery. On the other, many of their firms have put Americans out of work and used their profits to increase the wealth of shareholders.”ADCompanies also sent billions to shareholders: “Walmart, whose CEO spent the past year championing the idea that businesses ‘should not just serve shareholders,’ nonetheless distributed more than $10 billion to its investors during the pandemic while laying off 1,200 corporate office employees.”What the companies are saying: “The Post contacted all 27 large firms that held layoffs this year. Many said the cuts were not related to the pandemic, but instead a necessary part of broader ‘restructuring’ plans, where companies shift spending from declining lines of business to growing ones. In some cases, these plans were decided before the pandemic.”Behind the big-business boom: “Millions of consumers spent more time and money online during government-mandated shutdowns, watching Netflix, viewing ads on Google and Facebook pages, filling Amazon shopping carts and turning the video-game business into a bonanza for Nvidia, Microsoft and others.” (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)More from the U.S.:More than 16,928,000 cases have been reported; more than 306,000 have died. Biden will receive the vaccine as soon as next week. Vice President Mike Pence is expected to get vaccinated live on television Friday. Fauci says Moderna vaccine could be approved as soon as today: Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease expert, told CNBC that FDA authorization for emergency use for Moderna's vaccine candidate could come today. An FDA advisory committee is scheduled to meet this morning to discuss Moderna's vaccine, just as it did last week for Pfizer's shot.FDA says Pfizer coronavirus vaccine contains extra doses: “The discovery potentially expands the country’s supply by millions of doses as the Trump administration negotiates with Pfizer to speed up the next round of vaccine deliveries,” Fenit Nirappil reports.Hospitals are being pushed to the brink: “Hospitals reported more than 110,000 coronavirus patients on each of the past two days, a record count for the pandemic, according to tracking by The Washington Post. That is more than three times the number they treated in September and nearly double that reported at the height of the spring surge,” Brittany Shammas, Ariana Eunjung Cha, Ben Guarino and Jacqueline Dupree report.Interior Secretary David Bernhardt has covid: “Bernhardt’s infection has set off a wave of tests among high-ranking department officials. He has spent the past two days in meetings with political appointees,” Darryl Fears and Juliet Eilperin report. The secretary was tested before a Cabinet meeting, which he did not end up attending.From the corporate front:Top CEOs say vaccine mandates could be coming: “72 percent of current and recent CEOs of major companies signaled an openness to vaccine mandates, according to a poll held Tuesday at a virtual summit by the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. The broad question did not specify whether the mandate would apply to all employees or just ones who needed to work in close proximity to customers and colleagues,” CNN Business’s Matt Egan reports.Amazon asks U.S. to include warehouse, grocery staff in vaccine plans: “The request shows how the country’s second-biggest private employer, with 800,000 workers in the United States, considers the vaccine important to keeping its staff safe and its facilities open. The U.S. National Retail Federation made a similar request on the industry’s behalf as well,” Reuters’s Jeffrey Dastin reports.Tyson Foods fires 7 after betting inquiry: “The company fired top managers at its largest pork plant after an independent investigation into allegations that they bet on how many workers would test positive for the coronavirus. Tyson said the investigation led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder revealed troubling behavior …” the Associated Press reports.United launches effort to improve contact tracing: “The airline said it will begin asking domestic and international travelers this month to provide key contact information to aid the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s contact tracing efforts. …  The hope is that by collecting information directly from passengers, it can reduce the time it takes health officials to track travelers who may have been exposed to others on their flight who have tested positive for the coronavirus,” Lori Aratani reports.Around the world:ADMacron has covid: “France’s presidential palace announced that President Emmanuel Macron tested positive for the coronavirus. He  was administered a test after he began to show symptoms associated with covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. The 42-year-old president will now isolate for the next seven days but will continue his work, the statement added,” Paul Schemm reports.South Korea is struggling to contain its biggest outbreak to date: “The country reported more than 1,000 new covid-19 cases for second straight day on Thursday. The country also saw its biggest daily number in coronavirus deaths at 22, bringing up the total fatality figures to 612,” Min Joo Kim reports from Seoul.Market moversMixed day on Wall Street.Major indexes diverged slightly as traders wait on stimulus: “The S&amp;amp;P 500 closed 0.2 percent higher at 3,701.17, just below a record closing high. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 percent to end the day at 12,658.19, notching intraday and closing all-time highs, as Apple and Microsoft each popped more than 2 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, falling 44.77 points, or 0.15 percent, to 30,154.54,” CNBC’s Fred Imbert and Maggie Fitzgerald report.ADBitcoin surged past $20,000 for the first time: “It’s another benchmark in a mad-dash year that saw the digital currency more than double in value,” Hannah Denham reports.“It operates through peer-to-peer digital exchanges without a centralized hub, and its trading history is marked by wild swings. Bitcoin was trading above $10,000 in February, just before the coronavirus crisis took hold and it slid to about $4,000 within weeks. It was back above $10,000 by October amid growing demand from institutional investors and tech firms and is now up more than 150 percent since the start of the year.”The transitionBiden is considering Diana Taylor for his administration.She comes with deep Wall Street ties: “Biden is weighing Taylor for a number of positions, including administrator of the Small Business Administration … There was a specific discussion about that role over a week ago … although it’s unclear who else is in the running,” the New York Times's Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman report.AD“Taylor, a former managing director of Wolfensohn Fund Management and the former New York State banking superintendent under Gov. George E. Pataki (R), serves on the board of Citigroup and chairs the global nonprofit organization Accion. She is also the longtime partner of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and was the de facto first lady of New York City when he was in office.”Biden launches bid to tame the Senate. The president-elect is publicly rolling out his team. Behind the scenes, Biden is “grappling with a grittier challenge that could be critical to his presidency — dealing with an unruly Senate,” Annie Linksey reports. “Biden’s strategy, displayed in private conversations and some public actions, features two goals, both exceedingly difficult: winning the two Senate runoffs in Georgia to seize a razor-thin Democratic majority, while forging alliances with key Republican senators.”Other transition news:Two outsiders are the frontrunners for Education secretary: “The first is Leslie T. Fenwick, dean emeritus of the Howard University School of Education and a professor of educational policy and leadership. The second is Miguel Cardona, who last year was named the top education official in Connecticut,” Laura Meckler and Valerie Strauss report.Biden says Pete Buttigieg will play key role in rebuilding country as Transportation secretary: “The choice of Buttigieg, who sought the Democratic presidential nomination and has an ardent following among some members of the party, will bring a dash of star power to what is normally a staid, if important, department. He would also represent another first for a president-elect who has promised to build the most diverse leadership team in history: an openly gay Cabinet nominee confirmed by the Senate,” Ian Duncan and Michael Laris report.The regulatorsMassachusetts files complaint against Robinhood.State regulators allege the trading platform targeted inexperienced investors: “In a 24-page complaint, the enforcement arm of the Massachusetts Securities Division said Robinhood failed to protect its customers and their assets, violating state laws and regulations. Robinhood exposed Massachusetts investors to ‘unnecessary trading risks’ by ‘falling far short of the fiduciary standard’ adopted this year that requires broker-dealers to act in their clients’ best interest, the state said,” according to WSJ’s Caitlin McCabe.“The document focuses on the technological outages the platform has experienced and says Robinhood incentivizes frequent use, including by allowing customers with limited or no experience to attempt more complicated trades. Robinhood disagrees with the allegations, a spokeswoman said in a statement, and the company intends to defend itself vigorously.”Pocket changeCoca-Cola set a goal to diversify its ranks twenty years ago.But the company appears to be losing ground: In 2010, a decade after agreeing to pay a $192.5 million race-discrimination settlement, Coke appeared to be successfully implementing far-reaching changes to its employment practices. Now, “that progress has reversed,” the WSJ's Jennifer Maloney and Lauren Weber report. \"The share of Black executives is back down to 8 percent, according to company data. And the representation of Black employees among Coke’s U.S. salaried staff is now 15 percent, or 5 percentage points lower than where it stood in 2000.”Facebook says Apple is hurting small businesses: “Facebook said changes Apple has made to how easily advertisers can track iPhone users will disproportionately harm small businesses that rely on personalized advertisements to reach customers and find new ones. Facebook said its internal research has found that small businesses earned 60 percent less in sales when they were not able to use the kind of targeted advertising that Apple aims to limit,” Reed Albergotti reports.Texas leads GOP attorneys general in new Google antitrust suit: “Ten states led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, alleging the tech giant illegally sought to suppress competition and reap massive profits from targeted advertisements placed across the Web,” Tony Romm reports.“The lawsuit — filed in a Texas federal court and backed exclusively by Republicans — strikes at the heart of Google’s lucrative business in connecting those who seek to buy online ads with the websites that sell them.\"Supreme Court will hear NCAA dispute over compensation for student athletes: “The justices accepted a petition from the NCAA defending its restrictions on compensation for some college basketball and football players, which could have major implications for the way college sports is governed and the authority granted to the NCAA,” Robert Barnes and Rick Maese report.We Asked: Why Does Oreo Keep Releasing New Flavors?

The president plans to nominate the former Wall Street economist to head the bank, a pillar of the global order that Trump opposes, as soon as Wednesday.The appointment will probably trigger another clash between Trump’s “America First” views and the decades-old consensus over management of the global economy. Since 1944, when international financial institutions were created near the end of World War II, the United States has selected the bank’s president while European countries have controlled the top IMF job.ADAD“Malpass has never distinguished himself with an interest in the mission of the World Bank,” said Tony Fratto, former White House and Treasury Department spokesman in the George W. Bush administration. “It’s an odd ­career-capping type of appointment for someone with very little demonstrated interest in these topics. . . . It’s hard to see how he can be deemed qualified for this job.”Malpass, 62, has been openly critical of both the World Bank and IMF, saying there was “a lot of room for improvement” in the bank’s lending programs and calling for changes to better focus its operations. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that Malpass would be “a great choice” if Trump formally nominates him.“Globalism and multilateralism have gone substantially too far, to the point that they are hurting U.S. and global growth,” Malpass told a House subcommittee in late 2017.ADADStill, Malpass last year supported a $13 billion capital increase for the bank, its first in eight years, which was packaged with restructuring to internal operations and spending practices.If confirmed to run the bank, Malpass would seek to reduce lending to middle-income countries such as China and India, which he has said enjoy ready access to private capital markets.He would replace outgoing president Jim Yong Kim, who resigned unexpectedly this year to accept a private-sector job managing infrastructure investments in developing countries. Kim endured a rocky tenure at the bank, launching a disruptive reorganization that alienated the institution’s rank-and-file.ADThe Korean American physician cultivated administration support by partnering with Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, on a $350 million fund for female entrepreneurs in developing nations.ADAfter Kim resigned, she was included in one published report about possible replacements to helm the bank, a prospect the White House subsequently labeled “false.”The White House did consider other candidates, including Heidi Cruz, who works for Goldman Sachs in Houston and is the wife of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), according to a source familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named in discussing confidential discussions.In its most recent fiscal year, the bank doled out nearly $67 billion in financing, investments and guarantees, according to its annual report.ADAs word of the Malpass appointment leaked in recent days, it drew fire from bank allies. Malpass lacks the high profile of some former bank presidents, such as Robert McNamara, former defense secretary; Sir James Wolfensohn, a globe-trotting banker and investor; and Robert Zoellick, who had served as deputy secretary of state and chief U.S. trade negotiator.AD“Trump poses a unique threat to the international system. He’s nominating somebody, not just of dubious qualifications, but somebody who is committed to undermining the multilateral mission of the bank,” said Justin Sandefur, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development.Malpass worked on Wall Street as chief economist to Bear Stearns, the investment bank that collapsed amid the financial crisis in March 2008. Seven months earlier, even as some of the bank’s own hedge funds were failing, he wrote a remarkably sunny Wall Street Journal opinion article that played down the danger of an economic downturn.AD“Housing and debt markets are not that big a part of the U.S. economy, or of job creation. It’s more likely the economy is sturdy and will grow solidly in coming months, and perhaps years,” Malpass concluded.ADLittle more than a year later, the economy toppled into the worst recession since the 1930s.After Bear Stearns failed, Malpass unsuccessfully sought the 2010 Republican nomination to run for the U.S. Senate from New York. In 2016, he joined the Trump campaign as an economic adviser.At Treasury, he has been a fierce critic of the increasing role of the state in China’s economy and has participated in ongoing trade talks with Beijing. But he was forced into an embarrassing reversal one year ago after saying wrongly that the administration had “discontinued” an economic dialogue with Beijing.ADMalpass was forced to backtrack as the Treasury Department disavowed his comments.His nomination comes with several developing nations already impatient for a greater say in running international financial institutions.ADThe bank's board of executive directors will ultimately determine the next bank president. The United States controls almost 16 percent of the votes, nearly four times China's share, while European countries have more than one-quarter.“I think the Europeans will push back a bit,” said one former U.S. Treasury official, who asked for anonymity to discuss diplomatic conversations. “In the end, they’ll probably swallow it.”Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.]</td>\n",

       "0  James D. Wolfensohn, who led World Bank through tumultuous decade, dies at 86                                ...  [James D. Wolfensohn, the urbane investment banker who helped right the finances of major U.S. cultural institutions, including Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center, then focused a life’s experience in politics and finance on remaking the World Bank during a tumultuous decade as its president, died Nov. 25 at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightThe Institute for Advanced Study, a theoretical research institute in Princeton, N.J., where Mr. Wolfensohn was a past board chairman, announced the death. His son, Adam Wolfensohn, said the cause was complications from pneumonia.Mr. Wolfensohn was often characterized as a modern Renaissance man, as comfortable with the top figures of the arts world as he was with global business leaders and politicians. He was a native Australian who was an Olympic fencer in his youth. A classical music aficionado since his teens, he began cello lessons as an adult from the ailing star Jacqueline Du Pre.ADADIn what he referred to in a Forbes interview as “a totally egocentric affair,” beginning at age 50 he would gather top musician friends at Carnegie Hall to join him for once-a-decade birthday concerts.A onetime air-conditioning salesman, Mr. Wolfensohn climbed the world of high finance and joined the ranks of the global elite at the bond-trading house of Salomon Bros.  in New York. At Salomon he was put in charge of advising Chrysler as it edged toward bankruptcy in the late 1970s, adding to the sense of economic malaise that, along with the oil embargoes and war in the Middle East, rattled the presidency of Jimmy Carter.Helping arrange what was then the largest-ever corporate bailout in U.S. history, Mr. Wolfensohn was put in weekly contact with top officials such as Paul A. Volcker, then chairman of the Federal Reserve — further lengthening his list of contacts. He also proved his ability to work across borders, smoothing over a cultural rift between combustible Chrysler chief Lee Iacocca and the Japanese bankers who had  lent the Detroit auto company $600 million.ADADAfter receiving $10 million when Salomon was sold, Mr. Wolfensohn started his own boutique consulting firm and gradually built a client list that included companies as diverse as Mercedes-Benz and Ralph Lauren.But it was his work at the World Bank that defined his public life. After a middle-class upbringing in Australia, he wrote, early trips to India and Nigeria as an air-conditioning salesman had left “an indelible mark.”“The inequity was so striking that I could hardly absorb what was in front of me,” he wrote in his 2010 memoir, “A Global Life.” “I had known what to expect intellectually but the reality was a shock.”Changing the culture  at the World BankAs a result, even as he built a global career in finance, he trained his sights on the World Bank presidency. He even acquired U.S. citizenship to qualify for the job — under an unwritten rule it is the U.S. president’s job to fill — and put his “golden Rolodex” to work lobbying President Bill Clinton when the position opened up in 1995 after the death of Lewis T. Preston, a former president of JPMorgan Chase.ADADMr. Wolfensohn took over an institution besieged from both sides of the political spectrum. From the left, anti-globalization groups slammed the bank as little more than an extension of U.S. foreign policy, pressing private-sector economics and fiscal restraint on developing nations and ignoring local environmental and cultural concerns in the construction of large infrastructure projects. From the right, the World Bank was seen as an inefficient source of handouts to poorly performing countries.Mr. Wolfensohn did not quickly endear himself to an organization that one of his former staffers likened to a “big battleship,” constrained by its own inertia.He was apt to break into tears on trips to World Bank work sites in remote villages. He famously said the aim of the organization — a massive and staid bureaucracy — was to “put a smile on a child’s face.”ADADThat comment made him seem a naif to bank staff more acclimated to the organization’s technocratic approach to economic development. Combined with a temper honed on Wall Street and often trained on those who had dissatisfied him, it meant a rocky transition from the private sector to an organization that thrived on international politesse. Mr. Wolfensohn was apt to holler at staff and was quick with threats of firing.He also shattered some taboos — most notably the willingness within the bank to accept corruption as part of the cost of doing business in some parts of the world.“When I arrived at the bank, I was told, ‘You don't talk about the C-word because it is a political issue. The bank is owned by governments, and your charter does not allow you to enter into the political field,’ ” Mr. Wolfensohn said in a 1999 speech in South Africa.ADADAmong his first speeches as bank president was a landmark address on “the cancer of corruption,” in which he made the case that such practices were quite literally taking money away from the poor.Mr. Wolfensohn’s work on corruption has endured. The bank now regularly debars firms and cancels projects when it finds that payoffs or bribes have been involved.Wolfensohn biographer Sebastian Mallaby, in his book “The World’s Banker,” credits him with one other important change to the bank’s culture: focusing it more on the priorities of the developing countries that are borrowing the money and carrying out the work.Partly in response to complaints from nongovernmental groups that felt the bank staff was heavy-handed in its demands, Mr. Wolfensohn pushed the organization to ensure that local governments and civic groups had influence over what the bank approved and how it carried out its work.ADADTop staff were encouraged to move from the headquarters in Washington to field offices. A new lexicon developed within the organization as projects were vetted more closely for environmental effects, larger projects that often disrupted villages fell into disfavor, and local priorities became more important.The changes had a downside, according to critics who felt the organization by necessity became more bureaucratic and that its “safeguards” added time to an already lengthy project-approval process.But Mr. Wolfensohn’s basic insight was sound.“He was a relationship banker,” Mallaby said. “Wolfensohn turned the bank in that direction” by focusing on developing countries as clients to be courted and served, not pupils to be lectured. Mallaby said that Mr. Wolfensohn’s central point, credited with improving results on the ground, was that “it didn’t matter if a development project made sense if the country did not want to do it.”ADADHe was adept at managing as well. Over strong misgivings among leaders of the developed world, he pushed through debt relief for the poorest nations. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he pressed the case that development had to be part of the response — drawing a link between poverty, failed states and terrorism.The bank’s work in places such as Afghanistan expanded, the administration of President George W. Bush boosted foreign aid and  widespread chatter of Mr. Wolfensohn’s likely ouster fell silent.When he left the bank job in 2005, he had been invited into a former lion’s den — the annual meeting of Greenpeace — to give a keynote address, the World Bank’s main headquarters atrium was named in his honor and Bush tapped him to serve as the special envoy to the “quartet” of major nations then pursuing an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan.Early days in finance and fencingJames David Wolfensohn was born in Sydney on Dec. 1, 1933. His parents, Hyman Wolfensohn and the former Dora Weinbaum, had emigrated from London a few years earlier looking for economic opportunities.ADADHyman Wolfensohn, known as Bill, had spent years as a personal secretary to banking scion James de Rothschild — the future World Bank president was named in Rothschild’s honor — and hoped his experience and connections would let him launch his own career.He didn’t do well. In his autobiography, his son said his childhood was clouded by family tension over finances, a fact that shaped his approach to people. His father often avoided those who Mr. Wolfensohn later came to suspect were creditors. Even as a boy, he said, he developed a habit of studying any social setting to pick out potential allies and adversaries — a skill in “reading the room” that helped him in business.From his mother, who sang on Australian radio and gave her son piano lessons, he developed a love of music. He was unabashed enough to take on female roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas in high school and was an avid symphony fan.As a young man, Mr. Wolfensohn did not display any particular talents for academic success. He nearly flunked out of the University of Sydney, and one of his first investments was lost to a scam-artist “inventor.” His successes seemed to come not through natural genius but through intense application.Given a chance to join the university fencing team, for example, he practiced hard enough to gain a spot on the Australian Olympic squad. He won two of his bouts at the 1956 Melbourne Games but lost a third because of what he called a mental mistake described in “A Global Life.” His opponent distracted him during a break in the match with a party invitation and promises of an introduction to an Israeli swimmer.The Olympic training in fencing helped hone his sense of strategy. “Fencing is a little like chess,” Mr. Wolfensohn wrote. “You must project a few moves ahead and outthink your opponent.”If Hyman Wolfensohn’s highbrow connections were only of limited help to himself, they were gold in the hands of his son. An early mentor and family friend, Australian jurist Julius Stone, helped James get an internship at a top Sydney law firm and admission to Harvard Business School — positions that Mr. Wolfensohn allowed he would not have gotten on the strength of his academic credentials alone. (He received the Harvard degree in 1959 after having earlier graduated from the University of Melbourne’s law school.)While in Boston, he met Wellesley student Elaine Botwinick, whom he would later wed. His wife died in August. In addition to his son, of Brooklyn, survivors include two daughters, Sara Wolfensohn Mayle of Cambridge, Mass., and Naomi Wolfensohn of Long Island City, N.Y.; and seven grandchildren.After the stint selling air conditioners in Africa and Asia, he returned to Australia for jobs at different investment houses before graduating to the financial firms of London and New York.Restoring cultural landmarksBeginning as a dealmaker at investment banking firms such as Schroders in London, he moved in 1977 to Salomon in New York. He ensconced himself in New York’s cultural firmament, befriending people such as conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein.In 1980, Mr. Wolfensohn became chairman of Carnegie Hall and, after contributing $1 million, raised $60 million from his friends to renovate the venerable performance space. During his decade as chairman, he was credited with stabilizing the institution’s finances.In 1990 he was recruited to do the same for the Kennedy Center, suffering at the time from the sort of budget shortfalls that had beset Carnegie. In his memoir, he referred to the institution as a “white elephant,” with outdated equipment, a leaky roof, cracking granite and a hidebound approach to programming.He pushed crowd-pleasing programs — productions such as Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Cats” and “The Phantom of the Opera” — to fill the seats and lobbied Congress for a boost in funding. His ideas, particularly about programming, clashed with some of the center’s longtime employees and, according to news reports at the time, prompted longtime artistic director Marta Istomin to resign in 1990.During his five years guiding the Kennedy Center, he was said to have restored the physical building and the center’s finances, even if he fell short of some of his larger aspirations. At the time, he was criticized for dividing his time too thinly between his work in Washington, his private investment firm and other undertakings.Mr. Wolfensohn, who received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in 1995 for his contribution to the arts, served on corporate and charitable boards.He admitted to an inability to prioritize, turn down an invitation or reject a request to serve on such boards. Colleagues at the World Bank noted that they would load him down with reading, only to see him disappear into his office and spend the next hours on the phone.“What can I tell you? You get drawn into things,” he once told an interviewer. “Everything is interesting.”\\nRead more Washington Post obituaries]

Jordan Jr. never held elective office, was never a member of the Cabinet and never even worked for the federal government. He was a lawyer who rarely appeared in court, a corporate kingmaker who was not a registered lobbyist, a political strategist who did not direct a campaign.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightYet Mr. Jordan was, for years, one of the most influential figures in Washington. With a commanding presence, personal charm and an inviolable sense of discretion, he had a rare combination of talents that made him the confidant of presidents, congressional leaders, business executives and civil rights figures.Mr. Jordan was the consummate Washington power broker, reaching the peak of his quiet authority during the 1990s, when he was, with the possible exception of Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton’s closest adviser. He had Clinton’s ear through two terms as president, including the most challenging moments, when Clinton faced an investigation and impeachment for a relationship with a White House intern.ADAD“The last thing he’d ever do is betray a friendship,” Clinton said in 1996. “It’s good to have a friend like that.”Mr. Jordan died March 1 at his home in Washington. He was 85. The death was confirmed by his daughter, Vickee Jordan. She declined to state the cause.Mr. Jordan brought a smooth manner and elegant style to Beltway dealmaking, anchored in his youth in a housing project in the segregated South. He had the moral authority of a veteran of the civil rights movement — he nearly died in a 1980 shooting by a racially motivated would-be ­assassin — and was adept at navigating corporate boardrooms and golf course fairways, as well as gospel-filled churches.ADEarlier generations of Washington insiders had given advice from the sidelines, including Tommy “the Cork” Corcoran, Bryce Harlow, Clark Clifford, Lloyd Cutler and Robert Strauss — Mr. Jordan’s mentor at the Akin Gump law firm. But one significant way in which Mr. Jordan differed from his predecessors was he was among the few African Americans at the top of Washington’s power structure.ADIt was a role he had cultivated for decades. As early as 1971, when he became executive director of the National Urban League, Mr. Jordan outlined an approach to bring the civil rights struggle to the highest levels of government and business.“Black power will remain just a shout and a cry,” he said then, “unless it is channeled into a constructive effort to bring about Black political power and to influence the established institutions of American politics.”Instead of marching in the streets, Mr. Jordan marched toward the executive suite. He persuaded corporate leaders to hire Black workers and support institutions — most notably the Urban League — that benefited African Americans. By the time Mr. Jordan came to Washington in 1981, his influence could be felt from Wall Street to Congress to the grass roots of the civil rights movement.ADAD“I’m not a creature of the boardrooms,” he told People magazine that year. “I’ve got relatives on welfare. I’m a creature of the first public housing project for Blacks ever built in America,” in his native Atlanta.Photos: Jordan’s careerMr. Jordan was once under consideration to be commissioner of the National Football League and was rumored as a possible attorney general or ambassador to Britain. But he never accepted a nomination for any position that would require Senate confirmation.He sat on the boards of more than a dozen companies, vacationed on Martha’s Vineyard and wore custom-made shirts from Savile Row. For years, he spent Christmas Eve with Bill and Hillary Clinton, and presidents and billionaires attended his parties.ADYet the ways in which Mr. Jordan wielded his power remained something of a mystery. He had a magnetic quality, which Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) described to Vanity Fair as a “personality that seduces men and women differently, but nevertheless seduces.”ADMr. Jordan seldom left an official paper trail. People asked to discuss his clout in the capital often kept silent or sought his permission before responding.“He learned what it was to be the quintessential insider. He was sort of a fixer,” Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley said in an interview. “I don’t think he was feared as much as he was a custodian of Washington gossip. He had an accumulation of dirt that could be used as a wedge against an opponent.”ADMr. Jordan made his presence felt in phone calls and cloakroom whispers, in casual clubhouse conversations and across the luncheon table. IBM sought Mr. Jordan’s advice when it needed a new chief executive; he set the wheels in motion for James Wolfensohn to be named president of the World Bank; he recommended people for jobs ranging from summer intern to secretary of state.ADMr. Jordan had an affability and charm — and a sometimes intimidating 6-foot-4 physique — that put him at ease in any situation. He was often the only Black person in the room. He was a Democrat, but he counted many Republicans among his friends.“He has the ability and capacity to pick up the telephone almost any time and call almost any member of Congress, especially on the Democratic side of the aisle,” Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) said in 1992, when Mr. Jordan was co-chairman of Bill Clinton’s presidential transition team.He cultivated political figures on the rise, long before they acquired a national profile. Mr. Jordan first met Hillary Clinton in 1969, the year she graduated from college, and Bill Clinton in 1973, when he returned to Arkansas from law school at Yale. He met Barack Obama when the future president was a state senator in Illinois.ADADHe and Bill Clinton had a particularly warm rapport, with a shared Southern heritage and an interest in golf. Mr. Jordan was among the first to suggest Sen. Al Gore (D-Tenn.) as Clinton’s running mate in 1992. After Clinton was elected, Mr. Jordan vetted candidates for Cabinet positions and the White House staff. When he later visited those officials, he always brought flowers for their administrative assistants.“I have seen Vernon — too many times to count — help not just young people but any people,” Strauss told The Washington Post in 1998. “There are individuals in this country leading corporations and financial institutions and laboring in the vineyards because Vernon has been there to help and to make a few phone calls for them. That’s why people respect him.”One topic often whispered about away from Mr. Jordan’s presence was what a 1992 Post profile called his “reputation as a lady-killer” — which he declined to discuss, except to say, “I like all kinds of people. And I’m not going to stop liking people.”ADADTo Clinton, Mr. Jordan was a sounding board in good times and bad. He consoled the president after the 1993 suicide of deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster and after Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was killed in a plane crash in 1996.The relationship between the president and his counselor faced its most severe test in 1998, when Clinton was being investigated for an alleged relationship with White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky. Mr. Jordan reportedly arranged to hire a lawyer for Lewinsky and find her a job with Revlon, one of the companies of which he was a board member. (The job offer was rescinded amid the turmoil.)Mr. Jordan made five appearances before a grand jury during the independent counsel investigation of Clinton led by Kenneth W. Starr. He answered questions during a House inquiry that led to Clinton’s impeachment.ADADAs Republican opponents accused Mr. Jordan of conspiring with Clinton to obstruct justice, he did not lose his composure. He never discussed the scandal in public, even after Clinton was acquitted by the Senate.Mr. Jordan was so closely identified with Clinton that, as he later told the Los Angeles Times, “People look at me and believe that I was born January 20, 1993,” the day Clinton took office as president. “That is not true. My life was defined long before that.”'Vernon can read'Vernon Eulion Jordan Jr. was born Aug. 15, 1935, in Atlanta. His father was a postal worker on a military base.Mr. Jordan attended segregated schools, but he also was exposed to Atlanta’s elite White society while working for his mother’s successful catering business. At her urging, he left the South for college, attending DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind. He organized voter registration drives for Black residents of the region and became prominent in campus government and oratory.During his summer breaks, he returned to Atlanta, working as a chauffeur and waiter for an aging Robert F. Maddox, who had been the city’s mayor from 1909 to 1911. Mr. Jordan sometimes read the books in Maddox’s voluminous library, prompting a rebuke from his boss.Even after Mr. Jordan received permission to use the library, the former mayor told his family at dinner that he had an announcement to make: “Vernon can read.” Mr. Jordan never forgot the incident and used the backhanded comment as the title of his 2001 memoir.After graduating in 1957 from DePauw, where he was the only Black member of his class, Mr. Jordan entered law school at Howard University in Washington. He graduated in 1960, then joined an Atlanta firm led by a prominent African American lawyer, Donald L. Hollowell.The firm sued the University of Georgia on behalf of Charlayne Hunter, who became one of the college’s first two Black undergraduates in 1961. Mr. Jordan escorted her to class through jeering crowds.Soon afterward, Mr. Jordan became Georgia’s field secretary for the NAACP and led boycotts of stores that refused to hire Black workers. He moved to Arkansas in 1964 and coordinated voter registration efforts that added 2 million Black voters to rolls across the South.By 1969, Mr. Jordan was a fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, and the next year, he became executive director of the United Negro College Fund. When Whitney M. Young Jr., executive director of the National Urban League, drowned on a visit to Nigeria in 1971, Mr. Jordan was chosen as his successor.He oversaw a budget of $100 million and traveled extensively to raise money from corporate leaders to support job training, early-childhood education and other programs aimed at improving Black life in the United States. He joined the boards of blue-chip companies including American Express, Xerox, Dow Jones &amp; Co., Union Carbide and RJR Nabisco, and used his access to executives to encourage major companies to hire women and members of minority groups.Early on the morning of May 29, 1980, after addressing an Urban League gathering, Mr. Jordan was shot in the back with a high-powered rifle after exiting a car in a parking lot in Fort Wayne, Ind. He was rushed to a hospital, where doctors managed to close a wound the size of a fist. Mr. Jordan noted that the surgeon, the internist and the anesthesiologist who treated him in Fort Wayne were African American.“Now what that suggests,” he said, “is that there has been some progress.”President Jimmy Carter and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) went to Fort Wayne to see Mr. Jordan. After he was transferred to a hospital in New York, he was visited by Ronald Reagan, then a Republican presidential candidate, and a host of corporate titans as well as religious and civil rights leaders.Indiana authorities arrested Joseph Paul Franklin in connection with the shooting. Franklin had a history of racial violence, including shooting at mixed-race couples. (Mr. Jordan had stepped out of a car driven by a White woman.)At trial, Franklin was found not guilty of violating Mr. Jordan’s civil rights.Years later, Franklin confessed to the attack on Mr. Jordan and to an earlier shooting in 1978 that left Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt paralyzed. After having been convicted of eight and linked to as many as 20 killings nationwide, Franklin was executed in Missouri in 2013.D.C. eminenceDuring his 98-day hospitalization, Mr. Jordan reassessed his life. With the Urban League facing a chilly political climate with the incoming Reagan administration in 1981, Mr. Jordan moved to Washington as a senior partner with Akin Gump.He was sometimes described as a “superlawyer,” but his role at the law firm and lobbying shop resisted easy definition. He was not a registered lobbyist and did not argue cases in court.“If you ever see me in the library here, tap me on the shoulder,” he reportedly told a colleague. “For you will know that I am lost.”As the Clinton presidency was coming to an end in 2000, Mr. Jordan took a senior position at the New York investment banking firm of Lazard Frères, for a reported salary of $5 million a year.He retained his position at Akin Gump — “I’m there every Friday,” he said — and continued to be a presence in Washington.Mr. Jordan’s first wife, the former Shirley Yarbrough, died of multiple sclerosis in 1985, after 26 years of marriage. The next year, he married Ann Dibble Cook, a onetime professor of social work at the University of Chicago. In addition to his wife, of Washington, survivors include a daughter from his first marriage, Vickee Jordan of Washington; three stepchildren, Toni Cook Bush of Washington, Janice Cook Roberts and Mercer Cook, both of New York; and two grandsons.During the 2008 presidential election, he supported Hillary Clinton over Obama, saying, “I’m too old to trade friendship for race.”Yet Obama joined Mr. Jordan on the golf course and clearly recognized his eminence. Each year, as business moguls and political luminaries descended on Washington for the annual dinner of the Alfalfa Club, there was one invitation that was even more exclusive: brunch at Mr. Jordan’s house. Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos (Amazon founder and owner of The Post) and congressional leaders were likely to be there, rubbing elbows and sampling the omelets.Even when Obama skipped the Alfalfa Club’s white-tie dinner, he made time to show up at Mr. Jordan’s brunch.\\nRead more Washington Post obituaries]

       "2  The Finance 202: Fed's Powell warns Washington will remain on economic clean-up duty for foreseeable future  ...  [with Brent D. GriffithsJerome H. Powell has spent months all but skywriting over the Capitol that lawmakers should provide more emergency economic relief.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightNow, with Congress moving forward with a roughly $900 billion aid package and the vaccines that should eventually end the coronavirus pandemic rolling out across the country, the Federal Reserve chair has an updated message: This is no time for Washington to ease up.“Getting through the next four, five, six months, that is key,” Powell said at a news conference after the central bank’s last policy meeting of the year. “Clearly, there’s going to be a need for help there. And, you know, my sense and hope is that we’ll be getting that.”Powell, in circumscribed Fed-speak, emphasized that the work the Fed and Congress need to do to repair the economic wreckage from the pandemic won’t be done even once the vast majority of the population is inoculated.ADAD“We’re going to need to continue to provide support to this economy for quite a period of time,” he said, adding that although the economy “should be growing at a fairly healthy clip by the second half of next year, it’s going to be a while” before the labor market returns to the condition it was in at the beginning of this year.From RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas: For the central bank’s part, that means it will keep buying government debt and mortgage bonds until “substantial further progress has been made” toward a full recovery, the Fed said in updating its guidance. And most of its policymakers project the Fed will keep its benchmark interest rate near zero through at least 2023. The moves are aimed at encouraging economic activity by keeping borrowing costs low for individuals and businesses.ADADAnd as lawmakers self-impose a cap on their latest round of relief, Powell made clear strong investor appetite for government debt is giving Congress plenty of room to keep spending. Viewed through the lens of low real interest payments on the debt, “we're actually on a more sustainable fiscal path,” Powell said. It's a point some top economists have been emphasizing. From former top Obama economic adviser Jason Furman: Some economists faulted the Fed for not going even further. For example, the central bank for now has decided against shifting its asset purchases to longer-term bonds, which would further depress long-term interest rates. In a note, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson called it a “real missed opportunity.”ADAnd Powell declined to weigh in on the future of lending facilities it launched this year at the direction of the Cares Act. They are expiring, and it will fall in part on the incoming Biden administration to determine whether they should continue.Powell’s presentation reflects a balancing act.The Fed is wrapping up a year defined by the worst economic crisis in a century. In the near-term, a stalling recovery looks primed to deteriorate further. “November marked the slowest month of job growth since the spring, with the unemployment rate ticking down slightly from 6.9 to 6.7 percent,” Rachel Siegel notes. “Retail sales fell last month. Millions of Americans are behind on rent and utility bills, and nearly 8 million Americans have fallen into poverty since the summer.”ADADYet the economy has also bounced back faster than most forecasters expected. And the central bank now sees a brighter picture unfolding next year than it anticipated just months ago. Per Rachel, “In their latest round of economic predictions since September, Fed leaders predict that unemployment will fall to 5 percent by the end of next year, and 4.2 by the end of 2022. Officials also showed a more hopeful outlook for GDP. In September, Fed leaders projected that GDP would grow 4 percent by the end of 2021 but revised those estimates to suggest growth of 4.2 percent.”From former Treasury Department economist Ernie Tedeschi: The course of the pandemic will determine how the economy gets back on the road to recovery. Powell noted that economists’ projections to date have overestimated the havoc the crisis would wreak. He said the current spike in coronavirus infections “is so much larger” than what the country has seen so far that it is already registering in the economy, “particularly activity that involved people getting together in bars and restaurants, on airplanes, and hotels,” and other in-person commerce.Powell wouldn’t offer specific recommendations about the size or composition of the congressional relief package. Following Republican demands, for example, the emerging compromise on Capitol Hill leaves out direct aid to state and local governments. The Fed chair said that decision “is entirely in the hands of Congress.”ADADBut he did spell out the stakes, noting that budget shortfalls have forced state and local governments to lay off 1.3 million people since the start of the pandemic in March. That’s “a very large number of people to be out of work from just that one source,” he said — more than lost their jobs in the global financial crisis. “It’s a concern,” he said. Coronavirus falloutPresident-elect Joe Biden on Dec. 16 called the roughly $900 billion coronavirus aid bill taking shape in Congress a \"downpayment\" toward a bigger stimulus. (The Washington Post)Congressional leaders near agreement on aid package.The compromise includes a second round of stimulus checks. “The package emerging is expected to include hundreds of billions of dollars in aid for ailing small businesses and jobless Americans; tens of billions of dollars in aid for other critical needs, such as vaccine distribution and schools; and a one-time check of between $600 and $700 for millions of Americans below a certain income threshold,” Jeff Stein, Mike DeBonis and Seung Min Kim report.ADAD\"The relief bill is likely to be coupled with several other major legislative efforts — from legislation to fund federal agencies to a bipartisan effort to rein in surprise medical billing — that lawmakers could then pass into law in a matter of days.”The package includes $300 in enhanced jobless benefits. And, per my colleagues, “Democrats also secured $25 billion to establish a new program to provide emergency rental assistance, funding that could be used to cover past and future rent payments, as well as other related expenses.”Tensions are flaring as negotiations wrap up. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) got into a heated exchange on a Democratic conference call over Sanders’s demand for stimulus checks more generous than $600. “Manchin has said unemployment benefits are more essential to approve and helped spearhead a bipartisan compromise that Sanders has derided as insufficient.”President-elect Biden is embracing the deal. “The stimulus package is encouraging. It looks like it’s very, very close,” he said Wednesday. “It’s a down payment. An important down payment that’s going to have to be done. … It’s very important to get done.”The timing is tight. Per my colleagues: “Even if negotiators reach a deal Wednesday, clearing it through Congress by the Friday midnight deadline could be difficult. The House could vote as soon as Thursday, waiving its usual three-day rule for the review of legislation. The Senate would then have to secure unanimous consent among its 100 members to skip procedural hurdles and move to a final vote before the deadline. An objection from Sanders or any other senator could cause a brief government shutdown unless lawmakers agree to another short-term funding bill.”America’s biggest companies soared during the pandemic.They still laid off thousands of workers: “With few exceptions, big businesses are having a very different year from most of the country. Between April and September, one of the most tumultuous economic stretches in modern history, 45 of the 50 most valuable publicly traded U.S. companies turned a profit, a Washington Post analysis found,” Douglas MacMillan, Peter Whoriskey and Jonathan O’Connell report.AD“Despite their success, at least 27 of the 50 largest firms held layoffs this year, collectively cutting more than 100,000 workers, The Post found. The data reveals a split screen inside many big companies this year. On one side, corporate leaders are touting their success and casting themselves as leaders on the road to economic recovery. On the other, many of their firms have put Americans out of work and used their profits to increase the wealth of shareholders.”ADCompanies also sent billions to shareholders: “Walmart, whose CEO spent the past year championing the idea that businesses ‘should not just serve shareholders,’ nonetheless distributed more than $10 billion to its investors during the pandemic while laying off 1,200 corporate office employees.”What the companies are saying: “The Post contacted all 27 large firms that held layoffs this year. Many said the cuts were not related to the pandemic, but instead a necessary part of broader ‘restructuring’ plans, where companies shift spending from declining lines of business to growing ones. In some cases, these plans were decided before the pandemic.”Behind the big-business boom: “Millions of consumers spent more time and money online during government-mandated shutdowns, watching Netflix, viewing ads on Google and Facebook pages, filling Amazon shopping carts and turning the video-game business into a bonanza for Nvidia, Microsoft and others.” (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)More from the U.S.:More than 16,928,000 cases have been reported; more than 306,000 have died. Biden will receive the vaccine as soon as next week. Vice President Mike Pence is expected to get vaccinated live on television Friday. Fauci says Moderna vaccine could be approved as soon as today: Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease expert, told CNBC that FDA authorization for emergency use for Moderna's vaccine candidate could come today. An FDA advisory committee is scheduled to meet this morning to discuss Moderna's vaccine, just as it did last week for Pfizer's shot.FDA says Pfizer coronavirus vaccine contains extra doses: “The discovery potentially expands the country’s supply by millions of doses as the Trump administration negotiates with Pfizer to speed up the next round of vaccine deliveries,” Fenit Nirappil reports.Hospitals are being pushed to the brink: “Hospitals reported more than 110,000 coronavirus patients on each of the past two days, a record count for the pandemic, according to tracking by The Washington Post. That is more than three times the number they treated in September and nearly double that reported at the height of the spring surge,” Brittany Shammas, Ariana Eunjung Cha, Ben Guarino and Jacqueline Dupree report.Interior Secretary David Bernhardt has covid: “Bernhardt’s infection has set off a wave of tests among high-ranking department officials. He has spent the past two days in meetings with political appointees,” Darryl Fears and Juliet Eilperin report. The secretary was tested before a Cabinet meeting, which he did not end up attending.From the corporate front:Top CEOs say vaccine mandates could be coming: “72 percent of current and recent CEOs of major companies signaled an openness to vaccine mandates, according to a poll held Tuesday at a virtual summit by the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. The broad question did not specify whether the mandate would apply to all employees or just ones who needed to work in close proximity to customers and colleagues,” CNN Business’s Matt Egan reports.Amazon asks U.S. to include warehouse, grocery staff in vaccine plans: “The request shows how the country’s second-biggest private employer, with 800,000 workers in the United States, considers the vaccine important to keeping its staff safe and its facilities open. The U.S. National Retail Federation made a similar request on the industry’s behalf as well,” Reuters’s Jeffrey Dastin reports.Tyson Foods fires 7 after betting inquiry: “The company fired top managers at its largest pork plant after an independent investigation into allegations that they bet on how many workers would test positive for the coronavirus. Tyson said the investigation led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder revealed troubling behavior …” the Associated Press reports.United launches effort to improve contact tracing: “The airline said it will begin asking domestic and international travelers this month to provide key contact information to aid the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s contact tracing efforts. …  The hope is that by collecting information directly from passengers, it can reduce the time it takes health officials to track travelers who may have been exposed to others on their flight who have tested positive for the coronavirus,” Lori Aratani reports.Around the world:ADMacron has covid: “France’s presidential palace announced that President Emmanuel Macron tested positive for the coronavirus. He  was administered a test after he began to show symptoms associated with covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. The 42-year-old president will now isolate for the next seven days but will continue his work, the statement added,” Paul Schemm reports.South Korea is struggling to contain its biggest outbreak to date: “The country reported more than 1,000 new covid-19 cases for second straight day on Thursday. The country also saw its biggest daily number in coronavirus deaths at 22, bringing up the total fatality figures to 612,” Min Joo Kim reports from Seoul.Market moversMixed day on Wall Street.Major indexes diverged slightly as traders wait on stimulus: “The S&amp;P 500 closed 0.2 percent higher at 3,701.17, just below a record closing high. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 percent to end the day at 12,658.19, notching intraday and closing all-time highs, as Apple and Microsoft each popped more than 2 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, falling 44.77 points, or 0.15 percent, to 30,154.54,” CNBC’s Fred Imbert and Maggie Fitzgerald report.ADBitcoin surged past $20,000 for the first time: “It’s another benchmark in a mad-dash year that saw the digital currency more than double in value,” Hannah Denham reports.“It operates through peer-to-peer digital exchanges without a centralized hub, and its trading history is marked by wild swings. Bitcoin was trading above $10,000 in February, just before the coronavirus crisis took hold and it slid to about $4,000 within weeks. It was back above $10,000 by October amid growing demand from institutional investors and tech firms and is now up more than 150 percent since the start of the year.”The transitionBiden is considering Diana Taylor for his administration.She comes with deep Wall Street ties: “Biden is weighing Taylor for a number of positions, including administrator of the Small Business Administration … There was a specific discussion about that role over a week ago … although it’s unclear who else is in the running,” the New York Times's Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman report.AD“Taylor, a former managing director of Wolfensohn Fund Management and the former New York State banking superintendent under Gov. George E. Pataki (R), serves on the board of Citigroup and chairs the global nonprofit organization Accion. She is also the longtime partner of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, and was the de facto first lady of New York City when he was in office.”Biden launches bid to tame the Senate. The president-elect is publicly rolling out his team. Behind the scenes, Biden is “grappling with a grittier challenge that could be critical to his presidency — dealing with an unruly Senate,” Annie Linksey reports. “Biden’s strategy, displayed in private conversations and some public actions, features two goals, both exceedingly difficult: winning the two Senate runoffs in Georgia to seize a razor-thin Democratic majority, while forging alliances with key Republican senators.”Other transition news:Two outsiders are the frontrunners for Education secretary: “The first is Leslie T. Fenwick, dean emeritus of the Howard University School of Education and a professor of educational policy and leadership. The second is Miguel Cardona, who last year was named the top education official in Connecticut,” Laura Meckler and Valerie Strauss report.Biden says Pete Buttigieg will play key role in rebuilding country as Transportation secretary: “The choice of Buttigieg, who sought the Democratic presidential nomination and has an ardent following among some members of the party, will bring a dash of star power to what is normally a staid, if important, department. He would also represent another first for a president-elect who has promised to build the most diverse leadership team in history: an openly gay Cabinet nominee confirmed by the Senate,” Ian Duncan and Michael Laris report.The regulatorsMassachusetts files complaint against Robinhood.State regulators allege the trading platform targeted inexperienced investors: “In a 24-page complaint, the enforcement arm of the Massachusetts Securities Division said Robinhood failed to protect its customers and their assets, violating state laws and regulations. Robinhood exposed Massachusetts investors to ‘unnecessary trading risks’ by ‘falling far short of the fiduciary standard’ adopted this year that requires broker-dealers to act in their clients’ best interest, the state said,” according to WSJ’s Caitlin McCabe.“The document focuses on the technological outages the platform has experienced and says Robinhood incentivizes frequent use, including by allowing customers with limited or no experience to attempt more complicated trades. Robinhood disagrees with the allegations, a spokeswoman said in a statement, and the company intends to defend itself vigorously.”Pocket changeCoca-Cola set a goal to diversify its ranks twenty years ago.But the company appears to be losing ground: In 2010, a decade after agreeing to pay a $192.5 million race-discrimination settlement, Coke appeared to be successfully implementing far-reaching changes to its employment practices.

       "4  Trump pick for World Bank chief spent years criticizing its mission                                          ...  [Even before his nomination has been publicly confirmed, David Malpass, President Trump’s pick to run the World Bank, faces mounting attacks on his competence and lack of support for the bank’s mission.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightMalpass, undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs, is an outspoken critic of the bank and its sister organization, the International Monetary Fund. The president plans to nominate the former Wall Street economist to head the bank, a pillar of the global order that Trump opposes, as soon as Wednesday.The appointment will probably trigger another clash between Trump’s “America First” views and the decades-old consensus over management of the global economy. Since 1944, when international financial institutions were created near the end of World War II, the United States has selected the bank’s president while European countries have controlled the top IMF job.ADAD“Malpass has never distinguished himself with an interest in the mission of the World Bank,” said Tony Fratto, former White House and Treasury Department spokesman in the George W. Bush administration. “It’s an odd ­career-capping type of appointment for someone with very little demonstrated interest in these topics. . . . It’s hard to see how he can be deemed qualified for this job.”Malpass, 62, has been openly critical of both the World Bank and IMF, saying there was “a lot of room for improvement” in the bank’s lending programs and calling for changes to better focus its operations. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that Malpass would be “a great choice” if Trump formally nominates him.“Globalism and multilateralism have gone substantially too far, to the point that they are hurting U.S. and global growth,” Malpass told a House subcommittee in late 2017.ADADStill, Malpass last year supported a $13 billion capital increase for the bank, its first in eight years, which was packaged with restructuring to internal operations and spending practices.If confirmed to run the bank, Malpass would seek to reduce lending to middle-income countries such as China and India, which he has said enjoy ready access to private capital markets.He would replace outgoing president Jim Yong Kim, who resigned unexpectedly this year to accept a private-sector job managing infrastructure investments in developing countries. Kim endured a rocky tenure at the bank, launching a disruptive reorganization that alienated the institution’s rank-and-file.ADThe Korean American physician cultivated administration support by partnering with Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, on a $350 million fund for female entrepreneurs in developing nations.ADAfter Kim resigned, she was included in one published report about possible replacements to helm the bank, a prospect the White House subsequently labeled “false.”The White House did consider other candidates, including Heidi Cruz, who works for Goldman Sachs in Houston and is the wife of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), according to a source familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named in discussing confidential discussions.In its most recent fiscal year, the bank doled out nearly $67 billion in financing, investments and guarantees, according to its annual report.ADAs word of the Malpass appointment leaked in recent days, it drew fire from bank allies. Malpass lacks the high profile of some former bank presidents, such as Robert McNamara, former defense secretary; Sir James Wolfensohn, a globe-trotting banker and investor; and Robert Zoellick, who had served as deputy secretary of state and chief U.S. trade negotiator.AD“Trump poses a unique threat to the international system. He’s nominating somebody, not just of dubious qualifications, but somebody who is committed to undermining the multilateral mission of the bank,” said Justin Sandefur, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development.Malpass worked on Wall Street as chief economist to Bear Stearns, the investment bank that collapsed amid the financial crisis in March 2008. Seven months earlier, even as some of the bank’s own hedge funds were failing, he wrote a remarkably sunny Wall Street Journal opinion article that played down the danger of an economic downturn.AD“Housing and debt markets are not that big a part of the U.S. economy, or of job creation. It’s more likely the economy is sturdy and will grow solidly in coming months, and perhaps years,” Malpass concluded.ADLittle more than a year later, the economy toppled into the worst recession since the 1930s.After Bear Stearns failed, Malpass unsuccessfully sought the 2010 Republican nomination to run for the U.S. Senate from New York. In 2016, he joined the Trump campaign as an economic adviser.At Treasury, he has been a fierce critic of the increasing role of the state in China’s economy and has participated in ongoing trade talks with Beijing. But he was forced into an embarrassing reversal one year ago after saying wrongly that the administration had “discontinued” an economic dialogue with Beijing.ADMalpass was forced to backtrack as the Treasury Department disavowed his comments.His nomination comes with several developing nations already impatient for a greater say in running international financial institutions.ADThe bank's board of executive directors will ultimately determine the next bank president. The United States controls almost 16 percent of the votes, nearly four times China's share, while European countries have more than one-quarter.“I think the Europeans will push back a bit,” said one former U.S. Treasury official, who asked for anonymity to discuss diplomatic conversations. “In the end, they’ll probably swallow it.”Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.]

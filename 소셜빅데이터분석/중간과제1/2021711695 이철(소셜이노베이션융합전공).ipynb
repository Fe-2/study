       "      <td>.Dr. Megan Mahoney  examines patient Consuelo Castaneda as medical scribe Anu Tirapasur documents the visit at Stanford Family Medicine.Podiatrist Dr. Mark Lewis greets his first patient of the morning in his suburban Seattle exam room and points to a tiny video camera mounted on the right rim of his glasses. This is my scribe Jacqueline he says. She can see us and hear us.Jacqueline is watching the appointment on her computer screen after the sun has set 8000 miles away in Mysore a southern Indian city known for its palaces and jasmine flowers. She copiously documents the details of each visit and enters them into the patients electronic health record or EHR.Jacqueline  works for Augmedix a San Francisco startup with 1000 medical scribes in South Asia and the U.S. The company is part of a growing industry that profits from a confluence of health care trends — including now the pandemic — that are dispersing patient care around the globe.Medical scribes first appeared in the 1970s as note-takers for emergency room physicians. But the practice took off after 2009 when the federal Hitech Act gave health care providers incentives to adopt electronic records. These were supposed to simplify patient record-keeping but instead they generated a need for scribes. Doctors find entering notes and data into poorly designed record-keeping software cumbersome and time-consuming. So scribing is a fast-growing field in the U.S. with the workforce expanding from 15000 in 2015 to an estimated 100000 this year.A 2016 study found that doctors spent 37% of a patient visit on a computer and an average of two extra hours after work on record-related tasks. Electronic-record use contributes to physician burnout increasingly considered a public health crisis in itself.Before COVID-19 most scribes — typically young aspiring health professionals — worked in the exam room a few paces away from the doctor and patient. This year as the pandemic led patients to shun clinics and hospitals many scribes were laid off or furloughed. Many have returned but scribes are increasingly working online — even from the other side of the world.Remote scribes are patched into the exam rooms sound via a tablet or speaker or through a video connection. Some create doctors notes in real time; others annotate after visits. And some have help from speech-recognition software programs that grow more accurate with use.While many remote scribes are based in the United States others are abroad primarily in India. Chanchal Toor was a dental school graduate facing limited job opportunities in India when a subcontractor to Augmedix hired her in 2015. Some of her scribe colleagues also trained or aspired to become dentists or other health professionals she said. Now a manager for Augmedix in San Francisco Toor said scribing even remotely made her feel like part of a health care team.Augmedix recruits people who have a bachelors degree or the equivalent and screens for proficiency in English reading listening comprehension and writing the company said. Once on board scribes undergo about three months of training. The curriculum includes medical terminology anatomy physiology and mock visits.Revenue has grown this year and his sales team has grown from four to 14 members Augmedix CEO Manny Krakaris said. Sachin Gupta CEO of IKS Health which employs Indian doctors as remote scribes for their U.S. counterparts projects 50% revenue growth this year for its scribing business. He said the company employs 4000 people but declined to share how many are scribes.Remote scribe Edwin gives internist Dr. Susan Fesmire more time freeing her from having to finish 20 charts at the end of every day.It was like constantly having homework that you dont finish she said. With the help of Edwin — Fesmire said he declines to use his real name — she had the time and energy to become chief operating officer of her small Dallas practice. Edwin works for Physicians Angels which employs 500 remote scribes in India. Fesmire pays $14 an hour for his services.Doctors with foreign scribes say notes may need minor editing for dialectal differences and scribes may be unfamiliar with local vocabulary.I had a patient from Louisiana said Fesmire and Edwin said afterward What is chicory doctor? But she also praised his notes as more accurate and complete than her own.Kevin Brady president of Physicians Angels said their scribes start at $500 to $600 per month plus health care and retirement benefits while senior scribes make $1000 to $1500 — middle-class family incomes in India. Employers are required to provide employees with health insurance although many scribes are contractors and the job site Indeed.com says the average salary for a scribe in India is $500 a month. Scribes in the U.S. get about $2500.Remote scribing is still a small part of the market. Craig Newman chief strategy officer of HealthChannels parent to ScribeAmerica the largest scribing company in the U.S. said that the firms remote scribing business has increased threefold since the pandemics outset but that a large majority of the companys 26000 U.S. scribes still work in person.Its a highly unregulated industry for which training and certification arent required. The service typically costs physicians $12 to $25 an hour and studies show scribe use is linked to less time on patient documentation higher job satisfaction and seeing more patients — which can mean more revenue.For patients studies suggest scribes have a positive or neutral effect on satisfaction. Some have privacy concerns though and state laws vary on whether a patient must be notified that someone is watching and listening many miles away.Only 1% of patients refuse a remote scribe when asked by physicians at Massachusetts General Physicians Organization said Dr. David Ting the practices chief medical information officer. His group an IKS Health client always seeks patient consent Ting said.Scribes arent for everyone though. Janis Ulevich a retiree in Palo Alto California declines her primary care doctors remote scribe.Conversations with your doctor can be intimate said Ulevich. I dont like other people listening in.Some patients may not have the opportunity to decline. With limited exceptions federal laws like HIPAA the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 dont require doctors to seek a patients consent before sharing their health information with a company that supports the practices work  as long as that company signed a contract agreeing to protect the patients data said Chris Apgar a former HIPAA compliance officer.About one-quarter of U.S. states require all parties in a conversation to agree to be recorded meaning they require a patients permission. Some states also have special privacy protections for certain groups like people with HIV/AIDS or very strict informed-consent or privacy laws said Matt Fisher a partner at Massachusetts law firm Mirick OConnell.Remote scribing also raises cybersecurity concerns. Reported data breaches are rare but some scribe companies have lax security said Cliff Baker CEO of the health care cybersecurity firm Corl Technologies. UCSF experienced this in 2003 when a worker in Pakistan with a medical transcription company threatened to post patients confidential files online unless she was paid more.The next step in the trend could be no human scribes at all. Tech giants like Google EHR companies and venture-backed startups are developing or already marketing artificial intelligence tools aimed at reducing or eliminating the need for humans to document visits.AI and scribes wont eliminate physician burnout that stems from the nature of the health care system said Dr. Rebekah Gardner an associate professor of medicine at Brown University who researches the issue. Neither can take on burnout-driving EHR tasks like submitting requests for insurance company approval of procedures drugs and tests she said.Sarah Kwon is a California Healthline contributor.

Obviously clear and concise written content is essential but visual content is just as  important. And often the quality of your final product all comes down to the tools youre working with.If youre used to making assets from scratch then you know how much of a time-suck it can be. At the same time outsourcing the design process can cost an arm and a leg. So if youve given up on Photoshop and feel like youve exhausted all that Getty Images and other popular stock libraries have to offer it might be time to branch out and add some new tools to your kit.Luckily theres a package deal that boasts more than 3 million design assets and its on sale for only $50 for a limited time.

Workout routines have shifted toward living rooms neighborhoods and parks like never before. That means there is more diligence and self-planning beyond signing up for a Barrys Bootcamp class or yoga after work.Amazon knows all that and in an effort to get a bigger slice of the $34 billion fitness industry the e-commerce behemoth is releasing a product bundle directly into it: Amazon Halo and the Amazon Halo Band.Amazon Halo - Health &amp; wellness band and membership - amazon.com.More a Fitbit killer than an Apple Watch competitor Amazon Halo Band is a fitness tracker with a monthly membership built-in called Amazon Halo. A company press release describes the tandem subscription and device as AI-powered health tools with an innovative and stylish wrist band.As the product page explains membership includes stats on body composition tone of voice analysis and sleep &amp; activity tracking free for 6 months. After that the subscription auto-renews for $3.99 per month. If you cancel your subscription youll still get access to basic sleep time heart rate and step tracking.Here are a few more details on what Amazon Halo tracks:.The last point there is probably the greatest curio; according to the product listing it allows you to Maintain relationship health with tone of voice analysis. Hmm.If youre at all concerned with your boss finding out how you talk about her behind her back well Amazon assures you that Halo data is encrypted in transit and in the cloud and customers can download or delete their data at any time directly from the app.Theres a good chance the Amazon Halo Band will be a popular gift this holiday season—its about half the cost of a Fitbit Flex Wireless Activity + Sleep Wristband and less than half the price of an Apple Watch 3.  Thats how Amazon does it—it offers you inexpensive hardware so you sign up for a subscription. And based on Amazons success its hard to argue with the strategy.Hearst Newspapers participates in various affiliate marketing programs which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.Ryan Craggs is the Director of Content Marketing for Hearst Newspapers.

This is my scribe Jacqueline he says. She can see us and hear us.Jacqueline is watching the appointment on her computer screen after the sun has set 8000 miles away in Mysore a southern Indian city known for its palaces and jasmine flowers. She copiously documents the details of each visit and enters them into the patients electronic health record or EHR.Jacqueline  works for Augmedix a San Francisco startup with 1000 medical scribes in South Asia and the U.S. The company is part of a growing industry that profits from a confluence of health care trends — including now the pandemic — that are dispersing patient care around the globe.Medical scribes first appeared in the 1970s as note-takers for emergency room physicians. But the practice took off after 2009 when the federal Hitech Act gave health care providers incentives to adopt electronic records. These were supposed to simplify patient record-keeping but instead they generated a need for scribes. Doctors find entering notes and data into poorly designed record-keeping software cumbersome and time-consuming. So scribing is a fast-growing field in the U.S. with the workforce expanding from 15000 in 2015 to an estimated 100000 this year.A 2016 study found that doctors spent 37% of a patient visit on a computer and an average of two extra hours after work on record-related tasks. Electronic-record use contributes to physician burnout increasingly considered a public health crisis in itself.Before COVID-19 most scribes — typically young aspiring health professionals — worked in the exam room a few paces away from the doctor and patient. This year as the pandemic led patients to shun clinics and hospitals many scribes were laid off or furloughed. Many have returned but scribes are increasingly working online — even from the other side of the world.Remote scribes are patched into the exam rooms sound via a tablet or speaker or through a video connection. Some create doctors notes in real time; others annotate after visits. And some have help from speech-recognition software programs that grow more accurate with use.While many remote scribes are based in the United States others are abroad primarily in India. Chanchal Toor was a dental school graduate facing limited job opportunities in India when a subcontractor to Augmedix hired her in 2015. Some of her scribe colleagues also trained or aspired to become dentists or other health professionals she said. Now a manager for Augmedix in San Francisco Toor said scribing even remotely made her feel like part of a health care team.Augmedix recruits people who have a bachelors degree or the equivalent and screens for proficiency in English reading listening comprehension and writing the company said. Once on board scribes undergo about three months of training. The curriculum includes medical terminology anatomy physiology and mock visits.Revenue has grown this year and his sales team has grown from four to 14 members Augmedix CEO Manny Krakaris said. Sachin Gupta CEO of IKS Health which employs Indian doctors as remote scribes for their U.S. counterparts projects 50% revenue growth this year for its scribing business. He said the company employs 4000 people but declined to share how many are scribes.Remote scribe Edwin gives internist Dr. Susan Fesmire more time freeing her from having to finish 20 charts at the end of every day.It was like constantly having homework that you dont finish she said. With the help of Edwin — Fesmire said he declines to use his real name — she had the time and energy to become chief operating officer of her small Dallas practice. Edwin works for Physicians Angels which employs 500 remote scribes in India. Fesmire pays $14 an hour for his services.Doctors with foreign scribes say notes may need minor editing for dialectal differences and scribes may be unfamiliar with local vocabulary.I had a patient from Louisiana said Fesmire and Edwin said afterward What is chicory doctor? But she also praised his notes as more accurate and complete than her own.Kevin Brady president of Physicians Angels said their scribes start at $500 to $600 per month plus health care and retirement benefits while senior scribes make $1000 to $1500 — middle-class family incomes in India. Employers are required to provide employees with health insurance although many scribes are contractors and the job site Indeed.com says the average salary for a scribe in India is $500 a month. Scribes in the U.S. get about $2500.Remote scribing is still a small part of the market. Craig Newman chief strategy officer of HealthChannels parent to ScribeAmerica the largest scribing company in the U.S. said that the firms remote scribing business has increased threefold since the pandemics outset but that a large majority of the companys 26000 U.S. scribes still work in person.Its a highly unregulated industry for which training and certification arent required. The service typically costs physicians $12 to $25 an hour and studies show scribe use is linked to less time on patient documentation higher job satisfaction and seeing more patients — which can mean more revenue.For patients studies suggest scribes have a positive or neutral effect on satisfaction. Some have privacy concerns though and state laws vary on whether a patient must be notified that someone is watching and listening many miles away.Only 1% of patients refuse a remote scribe when asked by physicians at Massachusetts General Physicians Organization said Dr. David Ting the practices chief medical information officer. His group an IKS Health client always seeks patient consent Ting said.Scribes arent for everyone though. Janis Ulevich a retiree in Palo Alto California declines her primary care doctors remote scribe.Conversations with your doctor can be intimate said Ulevich. I dont like other people listening in.Some patients may not have the opportunity to decline. With limited exceptions federal laws like HIPAA the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 dont require doctors to seek a patients consent before sharing their health information with a company that supports the practices work  as long as that company signed a contract agreeing to protect the patients data said Chris Apgar a former HIPAA compliance officer.About one-quarter of U.S. states require all parties in a conversation to agree to be recorded meaning they require a patients permission. Some states also have special privacy protections for certain groups like people with HIV/AIDS or very strict informed-consent or privacy laws said Matt Fisher a partner at Massachusetts law firm Mirick OConnell.Remote scribing also raises cybersecurity concerns. Reported data breaches are rare but some scribe companies have lax security said Cliff Baker CEO of the health care cybersecurity firm Corl Technologies. UCSF experienced this in 2003 when a worker in Pakistan with a medical transcription company threatened to post patients confidential files online unless she was paid more.The next step in the trend could be no human scribes at all. Tech giants like Google EHR companies and venture-backed startups are developing or already marketing artificial intelligence tools aimed at reducing or eliminating the need for humans to document visits.AI and scribes wont eliminate physician burnout that stems from the nature of the health care system said Dr. Rebekah Gardner an associate professor of medicine at Brown University who researches the issue. Neither can take on burnout-driving EHR tasks like submitting requests for insurance company approval of procedures drugs and tests she said.Sarah Kwon is a California Healthline contributor.

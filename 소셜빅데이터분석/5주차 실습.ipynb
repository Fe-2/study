      "[For his new photo book, “Gentlemen’s Club,” Chris Buck spent six years interviewing and taking portraits of strippers and their romantic partners., “Partners of dancers are in this inherently complicated space of dating someone who’s intimate with others for their work,” he said. In that sense, the project is a study not only of labor, but also of relationships and fidelity., One question drove many of the interviews: How do you feel about your partner’s work?, “You shouldn’t be doing that. Wash dishes. Be a nurse. You’re a good girl. Take care of people,” Vincent from Jersey City, who is featured on the book’s cover, says in the book. (Mr. Buck included only first names.) Vincent adds that he doesn’t like his wife’s work, but it “pays the rent.”, Aaron, who is the main caregiver for two daughters, tells Mr. Buck he has struggled with his wife’s career. However, he says, “I get to spend all of my time with my girls, and it’s funded by her dancing.”, Others fully embrace the work. “I know that I’m the one that gets to go home with her at night,” says Haylie, a veterinary technician who lives in Baltimore. Besides working as a stripper, Haylie’s partner is a dominatrix, sex therapist and advice columnist., For many, Mr. Buck, 56, was the first person to pose the question. “A number of times, the partner would say, ‘My wife or girlfriend encouraged me to talk to you because they know I have no one else to talk to about this,’” Mr. Buck said. “It was framed as kind of therapeutic.”, Petr Sorfa, 52, lives in Portland, Ore., with his wife, Berlin, 39, who is open about her marital status with clients. Sometimes Mr. Sorfa visits her at the club., “If someone finds out you’re a stripper husband, they’re like, ‘wow’ or ‘how?’ They’re just interested in my wife,” Mr. Sorfa said in a phone interview for this article. “Even close friends wouldn’t ask me anything about it. Our parents know, and they haven’t said anything or asked anything.”, For the Sorfas, participating in Mr. Buck’s project was a chance to add another dimension to media portrayals of strippers and their families. “They don’t expect a normal person to be a husband of a stripper,” Mr. Sorfa said., Ms. Sorfa said that there isn’t much “honest coverage” about the lives of people like her. “I think there’s a reason for that,” she said. “It kills the fantasy when you’re a whole person. It’s harder to fetishize someone when they’re whole and they’re like you.”, Talonn Medley, 31, said that speaking for the book was an opportunity to “get rid of the stigma that strippers have no morals, come from a broken home, are cheap and dirty,” he said in a phone interview. He and his ex-wife met while both were working as dancers in nearby clubs in Portland, Ore. Now he lives in Springfield, Mo., with his husband and a son from his previous marriage, and is enrolled in a pre-med program; he has stopped stripping., “The more I speak about what my life actually was like, the more I can change people’s mind-sets,” he said., Mr. Medley knows what it is like to be both the dancer and the partner. “You have to have these emotional relationships with dozens of people every night,” he said. “Somebody has to be strong and know themselves emotionally. Otherwise jealousy will get in the way.”, Lily Burana, an author, journalist and a former stripper, wrote the foreword to the book. Ms. Burana said she tends to be skeptical of artists who want to do a “drive-by” of the lives of strippers, but Mr. Buck seemed different. “His email was perfectly professional,” she said. One “trigger” that gets people dismissed by strippers or sex workers is, Ms. Burana said, “‘I think you humanize the work.’ We were humans before you got here.”, Ms. Burana has written extensively about being a stripper, and was a lead plaintiff in a major labor rights lawsuit against a strip club in the 1990s. She believes that public attitudes have shifted considerably since then., “There’s an increase in respect, increase in care taken with the material. There’s an understanding that we’re hard-working and also very vulnerable to stigma and punitive misogyny and homophobia,” she said. “When I saw the book, I really felt like things are changing for the better.”]\n"

       "      <td>Libertie, the rebellious heroine of Kaitlyn Greenidge’s new novel, comes from an extraordinary family, but longs to be ordinary.As a young Black woman growing up in Reconstruction-era Brooklyn, Libertie is expected to follow in the footsteps of her trailblazing mother, a doctor who founded a women’s clinic. Instead, she flunks out of college and marries her first suitor, hoping to lead a tranquil domestic life.Greenidge based her book partly on Susan Smith McKinney Steward, who in the 1870s was the first Black woman to become a doctor in New York State. As she researched the family, she found herself drawn to the doctor’s wayward daughter, Anna. She became the model for Libertie, the kind of historical figure who is rarely celebrated: someone who simply wants to survive and thrive, not to be the first or the only one of anything.“So much of Black history is focused on exceptional people,” Greenidge said in a video interview earlier this month. “Part of what I wanted to explore is, what’s the emotional and psychological toll of being an exception, of being exceptional, and also, what about the people who just want to have a regular life and find freedom and achievement in being able to live in peace with their family — which is what Libertie wants?”Greenidge comes from a family of exceptional women herself. Her sister Kerri Greenidge is a historian who specializes in African-American and African diasporic histories, literature, and politics. Her other sister, Kirsten Greenidge, is an Obie Award-winning playwright and a theater professor at Boston University. Growing up in mostly white, wealthy suburbs around Boston, raised by a single mother who struggled to support the family on her social worker’s salary, all three felt pressure to succeed in rarefied fields where they often felt like exceptions.“That idea of being the first and the only was a big piece of our experience,” Greenidge said.Since the start of the pandemic, she has been quarantining with her mother and sisters in a woodsy suburb in central Massachusetts. Occasionally, when their interests and schedules have aligned, they’ve collaborated on creative ventures, including a podcast and a history project. They are engaged in ongoing conversations about their writing, though they draw the line at reading and editing drafts of one another’s work.“My sisters and I have always been extremely close and we are each other’s greatest fans, but we have always been our own people,” Kerri said.All three have risen to prominence in their respective genres, and they have produced enough award-winning literature to fill a bookstore display. Kirsten, the oldest, has written and staged around a dozen plays, works that often explore the lives of Black women and families in the Northeast. Kerri — who teaches at Tufts University, where she is the Mellon assistant professor in the Department of Studies in Race, Colonialism, and Diaspora — has published groundbreaking books about Boston abolitionists and the Black activist William Trotter. Kaitlyn, the youngest at 39, was hailed for her 2016 debut, “We Love You, Charlie Freeman,” a novel about a Black family taking part in a morally fraught experiment by adopting a chimpanzee and teaching him sign language. (She’s also a contributing Op-Ed writer for The New York Times.)With “Libertie,” which Algonquin is publishing next week, Greenidge is making a stylistic leap with an intricately researched and lushly imagined coming-of-age story set in 19th-century Brooklyn and Jacmel, Haiti. The novel has drawn praise from writers like Jacqueline Woodson, Mira Jacob and Garth Greenwell, who wrote in a blurb that Greenidge “adds an indelible new sound to American literature, and confirms her status as one of our most gifted young writers.”“There’s a really powerful lyricism that feels new in this voice,” said the novelist Alexander Chee, who was Greenidge’s writing professor at Wesleyan.For Greenidge, writing about Black women living through social upheaval felt like a return to her long-running obsessions: questions about whose stories get told as part of American history, how trauma is passed down across generations, what it means to be free of the past.“I’ve always been interested in the histories of things that are lesser known,” she said. “If you come from a marginalized community, one of the ways you are marginalized is people telling you that you don’t have any history, or that your history is somehow diminished, or it’s very flat, or it’s not somehow as rich as the dominant history.”Greenidge and her sisters developed a reverence for storytelling and history early on, when their parents and grandparents would tell stories about their ancestors and what life was like during the civil rights movement. Their grandparents were among the first Black people to move to Arlington, Mass., and recruited a white friend to pose as the home buyer, a scenario that Kirsten drew on in her play “The Luck of the Irish.”“That connected us to a historical narrative and possibly led to all of us studying history in our ways,” Kirsten said.Their mother, Ariel, encouraged them to find creative ways to entertain themselves. So they wrote stories, played instruments and staged elaborate plays that Kirsten wrote. They recorded make-believe radio shows on a cassette player, belting out the soundtracks to “Grease,” and other musicals.Kaitlyn was a precocious reader and absorbed books far above her grade level because her sisters would read aloud from whatever they were into at the time, regardless of whether the plots were appropriate. “We scared the heck out of that poor kid,” Kirsten said.Outside of their boisterous, creative home life, the sisters were keenly aware of race and class and how it defined them in the largely white prep schools they attended. Those issues became more pronounced after their mother and father, a lawyer, divorced, when Kaitlyn was 7. Suddenly, they went from being upper middle class to sliding below the poverty line and relying on public assistance.“That fracture was really formative for me,” she said. “It made me hyper aware of inequality and the doublespeak that goes on in America around the American dream and American exceptionalism, because that was proven to me not to be true.”The change in the family’s economic status also increased the pressure the sisters felt to excel. “As young women of color in America, that was made clear to us from very early on, definitely feeling the onus of, How are you going to put your education to use?” Kirsten said.After Kaitlyn Greenidge graduated from Wesleyan, she worked as a park ranger, phone banker and researcher at historical sites, and designed a vocabulary app for an education technology company. She kept writing, publishing essays and articles and, eventually, her debut novel, which won her a Whiting Award in fiction.She got the idea for “Libertie” a decade ago, when she was working at the Weeksville Heritage Center, a museum dedicated to a free Black community that was founded in Brooklyn in 1838. Greenidge was collecting stories from people whose ancestors had lived there, and tracked down a woman named Ellen Holly, who was the first Black actress to have a lead, recurring role on daytime TV, in “One Life to Live.” Holly spoke about her great-grandmother Susan Smith McKinney Steward, whose daughter Anna married a son of the Episcopal archbishop of Haiti and moved with him to Port-au-Prince, but came to regret it.Greenidge filed the family’s saga away in her mind, thinking she had the premise for a novel. When she got a writing fellowship, she was able to quit her side jobs and immerse herself in the research the novel required. She read old newspapers, political tracts, sermons, memoirs, hymns and census records. Occasionally, she turned to Kerri — she affectionately calls her older sister a “history nerd” — for advice. “She’s a human Wikipedia,” she said. “How could you not?”The resulting story feels both epic and intimate. As she reimagined the lives of the doctor and her daughter, Greenidge wove in other historical figures and events. In one horrific scene, Libertie and her mother tend to Black families who fled Manhattan during the New York City draft riots. In the novel’s opening chapter, Libertie sees her mother revive a man who arrives at their home sealed in a coffin, brought by a woman who works on the Underground Railroad. Greenidge based the woman on Henrietta Duterte, a Black abolitionist in Philadelphia who used her funeral home to help people escape.Greenidge also drew on her own family history, and her experience of being a new mother. Her daughter, Mavis, was born days after she finished a second draft of the book, and is now 18 months old. She finished revisions while living in a multigenerational household with her own mother and sisters.“Mother-daughter relationships are like the central relationships in my life,” she said. “One of the things I was interested in was motherhood as this place of self-creation.”She took inspiration from Toni Morrison, who once described motherhood as “the most liberating thing that ever happened to me.”That idea, of motherhood as a catalyst for self-discovery, became a refrain toward the end of the novel, when Libertie reads a letter from her mother. “I cannot think of a greater freedom than raising you,” it says.Follow New York Times Books on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.

       "      <td>In the coming days, a patent will finally be issued on a five-year-old invention, a feat of molecular engineering that is at the heart of at least five major Covid-19 vaccines. And the United States government will control that patent.The new patent presents an opportunity — and some argue the last best chance — to exact leverage over the drug companies producing the vaccines and pressure them to expand access to less affluent countries.The question is whether the government will do anything at all.The rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines, achieved at record speed and financed by massive public funding in the United States, the European Union and Britain, represents a great triumph of the pandemic. Governments partnered with drugmakers, pouring in billions of dollars to procure raw materials, finance clinical trials and retrofit factories. Billions more were committed to buy the finished product.But this Western success has created stark inequity. Residents of wealthy and middle-income countries have received about 90 percent of the nearly 400 million vaccines delivered so far. Under current projections, many of the rest will have to wait years.Growing numbers of health officials and advocacy groups worldwide are calling for Western governments to use aggressive powers — most of them rarely or never used before — to force companies to publish vaccine recipes, share their know-how and ramp up manufacturing. Public health advocates have pleaded for help, including asking the Biden administration to use its patent to push for broader vaccine access.Governments have resisted. By partnering with drug companies, Western leaders bought their way to the front of the line. But they also ignored years of warnings — and explicit calls from the World Health Organization — to include contract language that would have guaranteed doses for poor countries or encouraged companies to share their knowledge and the patents they control.“It was like a run on toilet paper. Everybody was like, ‘Get out of my way. I’m gonna get that last package of Charmin,’” said Gregg Gonsalves, a Yale epidemiologist. “We just ran for the doses.”The prospect of billions of people waiting years to be vaccinated poses a health threat to even the richest countries. One example: In Britain, where the vaccine rollout has been strong, health officials are tracking a virus variant that emerged in South Africa, where vaccine coverage is weak. That variant may be able to blunt the effect of vaccines, meaning even vaccinated people might get sick.Western health officials said they never intended to exclude others. But with their own countries facing massive death tolls, the focus was at home. Patent sharing, they said, simply never came up.“It was U.S.-centric. It wasn’t anti-global.” said Moncef Slaoui, who was the chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, a Trump administration program that funded the search for vaccines in the United States. “Everybody was in agreement that vaccine doses, once the U.S. is served, will go elsewhere.”President Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union’s executive branch, are reluctant to change course. Mr. Biden has promised to help an Indian company produce about 1 billion doses by the end of 2022 and his administration has donated doses to Mexico and Canada. But he has made it clear that his focus is at home.“We’re going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of first,” Mr. Biden said recently. “But we’re then going to try and help the rest of the world.”Pressuring companies to share patents could be seen as undermining innovation, sabotaging drugmakers or picking drawn-out and expensive fights with the very companies digging a way out of the pandemic.As rich countries fight to keep things as they are, others like South Africa and India have taken the battle to the World Trade Organization, seeking a waiver on patent restrictions for Covid-19 vaccines.Russia and China, meanwhile, have promised to fill the void as part of their vaccine diplomacy. The Gamaleya Institute in Moscow, for example, has entered into partnerships with producers from Kazakhstan to South Korea, according to data from Airfinity, a science analytics company, and UNICEF. Chinese vaccine makers have reached similar deals in the United Arab Emirates, Brazil and Indonesia.Addressing patents would not, by itself, solve the vaccine imbalance. Retrofitting or constructing factories would take time. More raw materials would need to be manufactured. Regulators would have to approve new assembly lines.And as with cooking a complicated dish, giving someone a list of ingredients is no substitute to showing them how to make it.To address these problems, the World Health Organization created a technology pool last year to encourage companies to share know-how with manufacturers in lower-income nations.Not a single vaccine company has signed up.“The problem is that the companies don’t want to do it. And the government is just not very tough with the companies,” said James Love, who leads Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit.Drug company executives told European lawmakers recently that they were licensing their vaccines as quickly as possible, but that finding partners with the right technology was challenging.“They don’t have the equipment,” Moderna’s chief executive, Stéphane Bancel, said. “There is no capacity.”But manufacturers from Canada to Bangladesh say they can make vaccines — they just lack patent licensing deals. When the price is right, companies have shared secrets with new manufacturers in just months, ramping up production and retrofitting factories.It helps when the government sweetens the deal. Earlier this month, Mr. Biden announced that the pharmaceutical giant Merck would help make vaccines for its competitor Johnson &amp; Johnson. The government pressured Johnson &amp; Johnson to accept the help and is using wartime procurement powers to secure supplies for the company. It will also pay to retrofit Merck’s production line, with an eye toward making vaccines available to every adult in the United States by May.Despite the hefty government funding, drug companies control nearly all of the intellectual property and stand to make fortunes off the vaccines. A critical exception is the patent expected to be approved soon — a government-led discovery for manipulating a key coronavirus protein.This breakthrough, at the center of the 2020 race for a vaccine, actually came years earlier in a National Institutes of Health lab, where an American scientist named Dr. Barney Graham was in pursuit of a medical moonshot.For years, Dr. Graham specialized in the kind of long, expensive research that only governments bankroll. He searched for a key to unlock universal vaccines — genetic blueprints to be used against any of the roughly two dozen viral families that infect humans. When a new virus emerged, scientists could simply tweak the code and quickly make a vaccine.In 2016, while working on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, another coronavirus known as MERS, he and his colleagues developed a way to swap a pair of amino acids in the coronavirus spike protein. That bit of molecular engineering, they realized, could be used to develop effective vaccines against any coronavirus. The government, along with its partners at Dartmouth College and the Scripps Research Institute, filed for a patent, which will be issued this month.When Chinese scientists published the genetic code of the new coronavirus in January 2020, Dr. Graham’s team had their cookbook ready.“We kind of knew exactly what we had to do,” said Jason McLellan, one of the inventors, who now works at the University of Texas at Austin. “We’d already done everything.”Dr. Graham was already working with Moderna on a vaccine for another virus when the outbreak in China inspired his team to change focus. “We just flipped it to coronavirus and said, ‘How fast can we go?’” Dr. Graham recalled.Within a few days, they emailed the vaccine’s genetic blueprint to Moderna to begin manufacturing. By late February, Moderna had produced enough vaccines for government-run clinical trials.“We did the front end. They did the middle. And we did the back end,” Dr. Graham said.Exactly who holds patents for which vaccines won’t be sorted out for months or years. But it is clear now that several of today’s vaccines — including those from Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novavax, CureVac and Pfizer-BioNTech — rely on the 2016 invention. Of those, only BioNTech has paid the U.S. government to license the technology. The patent is scheduled to be issued March 30.Patent lawyers and public health advocates say it’s likely that other companies will either have to negotiate a licensing agreement with the government, or face the prospect of a lawsuit worth billions. The government filed such a lawsuit in 2019 against the drugmaker Gilead over H.I.V. medication.This gives the Biden administration leverage to force companies to share technology and expand worldwide production, said Christopher J. Morten, a New York University law professor specializing in medical patents.“We can do this the hard way, where we sue you for patent infringement,” he said the government could assert. “Or just play nice with us and license your tech.”The National Institutes of Health declined to comment on its discussions with the drugmakers but said it did not anticipate a dispute over patent infringement. None of the drug companies responded to repeated questions about the 2016 patent.Experts said the government has stronger leverage on the Moderna vaccine, which was almost entirely funded by taxpayers. New mRNA vaccines, such as those from Moderna, are relatively easier to manufacture than vaccines that rely on live viruses. Scientists compare it to an old-fashioned cassette player: Try one tape. If it’s not right, just pop in another.Moderna expects $18.4 billion in vaccine sales this year, but it is the delivery system — the cassette player — that is its most prized secret. Disclosing it could mean giving away the key to the company’s future.By last spring, with the Moderna vaccine in its earliest trials, vaccine science had clearly become a nationalistic competition. World leaders joined the W.H.O. in April to raise $8 billion for Covid-19 vaccines, tests and treatments, but China and the United States were notably absent.“There should be no division in order to win this battle,” President Emmanuel Macron of France said.Yet European governments had backed their own champions. The European Investment Bank lent nearly $120 million to BioNTech, a German company, and Germany bought a $360 million stake in the biotech firm CureVac after reports that it was being lured to the United States.“We funded the research, on both sides of the Atlantic,” said Udo Bullmann, a German member of the European Parliament. “You could have agreed on a paragraph that says ‘You are obliged to give it to poor countries in a way that they can afford it.’ Of course you could have.”In May, the leaders of Pakistan, Ghana, South Africa and others called for governments to support a “people’s vaccine” that could be quickly manufactured and given for free.They urged the governing body of the World Health Organization to treat vaccines as “global public goods.”Though such a declaration would have had no teeth, the Trump administration moved swiftly to block it. Intent on protecting intellectual property, the government said calls for equitable access to vaccines and treatments sent “the wrong message to innovators.”World leaders ultimately approved a watered-down declaration that recognized extensive immunization — not the vaccines themselves — as a global public good.That same month, the World Health Organization launched the technology-access pool and called on governments to include clauses in their drug contracts guaranteeing equitable distribution. But the world’s richest nations roundly ignored the call.In the United States, Operation Warp Speed went on a summertime spending spree, disbursing over $10 billion to handpicked companies and absorbing the financial risks of bringing a vaccine to market.“Our role was to enable the private sector to be successful,” said Paul Mango, a top adviser to the then health secretary, Alex M. Azar II.The deals came with few strings attached.Large chunks of the contracts are redacted and some remain secret. But public records show that the government used unusual contracts that omitted its right to take over intellectual property or influence the price and availability of vaccines. They did not let the government compel companies to share their technology.British and other European leaders made similar concessions as they ordered enough doses to vaccinate their populations multiple times over.“You have to write the rules of the game, and the place to do that would have been these funding contracts,” said Ellen ’t Hoen, the director of Medicines Law and Policy, an international research group.By comparison, one of the world’s largest health financiers, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, includes grant language requiring equitable access to vaccines. As leverage, the organization retains some right to the intellectual property.Dr. Slaoui, who came to Warp Speed after leading research and development at GlaxoSmithKline, is sympathetic to this idea. But it would have been impractical to demand patent concessions and still deliver on the program’s primary goals of speed and volume, he said.“I can guarantee you that the agreements with the companies would have been much more complex and taken a much longer time,” he said. The European Union, for example, haggled over price and liability provisions, which delayed the rollout.In some ways, this was a trip down a trodden path. When the H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic broke out in 2009, the wealthiest countries cornered the global vaccine market and all but locked out the rest of the world.Experts said at the time that this was a chance to rethink the approach. But the swine flu pandemic fizzled and governments ended up destroying the vaccines they had hoarded. They then forgot to prepare for the future.For months, the United States and European Union have blocked a proposal at the World Trade Organization that would waive intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. The application, put forward by South Africa and India with support from most developing nations, has been bogged down in procedural hearings.“Every minute we are deadlocked in the negotiating room, people are dying,” said Mustaqeem De Gama, a South African diplomat who is involved in the talks.But in Brussels and Washington, leaders are still worried about undermining innovation.During the presidential campaign, Mr. Biden’s team gathered top intellectual property lawyers to discuss ways to increase vaccine production.“They were planning on taking the international view on things,” said Ana Santos Rutschman, a Saint Louis University law professor who participated in the sessions.Most of the options were politically thorny. Among them was the use of a federal law allowing the government to seize a company’s patent and give it to another in order to increase supply. Former campaign advisers say the Biden camp was lukewarm to this proposal and others that called for a broader exercise of its powers.The administration has instead promised to give $4 billion to Covax, the global vaccine alliance. The European Union has given nearly $1 billion so far. But Covax aims to vaccinate only 20 percent of people in the world’s poorest countries this year, and faces a $2 billion shortfall even to accomplish that.Dr. Graham, the N.I.H. scientist whose team cracked the coronavirus vaccine code for Moderna, said that pandemic preparedness and vaccine development should be international collaborations, not competitions.“A lot of this would not have happened unless there was a big infusion of government money,” he said.But governments cannot afford to sabotage companies that need profit to survive.Dr. Graham has largely moved on from studying the coronavirus. He is searching for a universal flu vaccine, a silver bullet that could prevent all strains of the disease without an annual tweak.Though he was vaccinated through work, he spent the early part of the year trying to get his wife and grown children onto waiting lists — an ordeal that even one of the key inventors had to endure. “You can imagine how aggravating that is,” he said.Matina Stevis-Gridneff and Monika Pronczuk contributed reporting.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Canadian-Chinese tensions worsened Monday as China put a former Canadian diplomat on trial on spying charges, the second such trial in recent days, while Canada sanctioned four Chinese officials and one state entity for human-rights violations against the Uyghur minority.A court in Beijing held the trial of the former diplomat, Michael Kovrig, who was detained by the Chinese authorities in late 2018, shortly after Canada arrested a top executive at the Chinese technology firm Huawei at the request of the United States.The trial was conducted in secret, with the Chinese authorities barring foreign diplomats and journalists from attending. In a show of support for Mr. Kovrig, more than two dozen diplomats representing several countries, including Canada and the United States, tried to gain access to the courtroom, only to be turned away by security personnel.Government officials, legal scholars and human rights activists denounced China’s decision to hold the trial, just days after another Canadian, Michael Spavor, a businessman who was also detained in 2018, appeared before a court in Dandong, a northeastern city. Critics have described the trials as a sham meant as retaliation for the arrest of the Huawei executive, and accuse China of resorting to “hostage diplomacy.”“We are deeply troubled by the total lack of transparency surrounding these hearings and we continue to work toward an immediate end to their arbitrary detention,” the Canadian foreign minister, Marc Garneau, said in a statement.In Canada, the trials have reinforced an already simmering backlash against China, and are pushing the country to re-evaluate its relations with Beijing. In a sign of Canada’s determination to hold China accountable on human rights, Canada joined the United States, the European Union and Britain on Monday to impose sanctions against four Chinese officials and one Chinese state entity involved in repressing China’s Uyghur population in the northwestern Xinjiang region.In February, Canada’s House of Commons voted overwhelmingly to call China’s treatment of the Uyghurs a genocide, while Ottawa has also criticized China’s clampdown in Hong Kong. According to a recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute, a leading polling company, only 14 percent of Canadians have a favorable view of China.“China’s recent moves — hostage-taking of Canadians, threatening allies such as Australia, hacking away at Hong Kong autonomy, questioning the delicate balance in Taiwan and scaring the neighbors with muscle-flexing — are driving Canada to seek a closer alignment with the U.S.,” The Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper, said in an editorial, urging Canada to roll back its economic dependence on China.The detention of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor appears to be part of an effort by China to win the release of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei and the daughter of the company’s founder. Ms. Meng faces sweeping fraud charges in the United States, which is seeking her extradition.China on Monday defended its decision to go forward with the trial of Mr. Kovrig. The court in Beijing said in a brief statement that he was tried on charges of “gathering state secrets and intelligence for foreign countries” and that a verdict would be announced at a later date.In combative remarks, Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, rejected criticism that the trials should be open to the public and accused Canada of acting as an accomplice to American efforts to undermine China.“This is a political incident through and through,” Ms. Hua said at a news conference in Beijing, referring to Ms. Meng’s case.The prosecutions of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor have unfolded against a backdrop of growing tensions over China’s increasingly assertive behavior on the global stage.American officials on Monday denounced China’s decision to go forward with the trials, saying they were inconsistent with international human rights agreements.“The charges are a blatant attempt to use human beings as bargaining leverage,” a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Beijing said in a statement. “The practice of arbitrary detention to exercise leverage over foreign governments is completely unacceptable.”The Biden administration is working to build coalitions of countries to counter China’s strength and limit its transgressions, including on human rights issues.But China’s authoritarian leader, Xi Jinping, appears increasingly unbothered by the threat of international condemnation, and his government seems eager to demonstrate it will not bow to demands from the United States.At a meeting last week in Alaska, American officials raised the detentions of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor with their Chinese counterparts, according to a senior Biden administration official. The Americans also expressed concerns about the exclusion of foreign diplomats from the trials. The talks identified areas of sharp disagreements as well as what Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken described as intersecting interests, although ultimately the two sides left without a joint statement of their willingness to work together.“Beijing has shown time and time again that it frankly does not care what the international community disapproves of,” said Diana Fu, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto. “It is playing by its own rules, like it or not.”While verdicts have not yet been announced in the cases of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor, both men are likely to be convicted. Chinese courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party, and convictions are almost certain, especially in cases involving national security. During court proceedings, there are limited opportunities to examine evidence or hear rebuttals.Chinese courts typically shroud such cases in secrecy so that the authorities can maximize control over the outcomes, said Joshua Rosenzweig, head of Amnesty International’s China team.“Whatever the results for Kovrig and Spavor,” Mr. Rosenzweig said, “China will want to keep everything under wraps to ensure that it has as much control over the narrative as possible.”Mr. Kovrig has detailed the difficult conditions he faces in prison to family during the few times he has been allowed to speak with them. He has said that he has been confined to a small jail cell in Beijing and subjected to repeated interrogations. His diet has, at times, been restricted to rice and boiled vegetables.His friends and former co-workers on Monday reiterated calls for his release, saying China, Canada and the United States should redouble efforts to resolve the issue.“This is a political case, not a legal one,” said Richard Atwood, interim president of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based research organization where Mr. Kovrig worked as an adviser. “Anyone with the power to end this unjust, arbitrary detention should do whatever is possible to do so.”Mr. Kovrig’s wife, Vina Nadjibulla, said in an interview that she hoped international support for Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor would help bring about their release.“Michael shouldn’t have been there to begin with,” she said. “This has been an unjust and arbitrary detention since day one and Monday’s trial didn’t change that fact.”Dan Bilefsky and Lara Jakes contributed reporting.

       "      <td>The banning of menthol cigarettes, the mint-flavored products that have been aggressively marketed to Black Americans, has long been an elusive goal for public health regulators.But Covid-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement have put new pressure on Congress and the White House to reduce racial health disparities. And there are few starker examples than this: Black smokers smoke less but die of heart attacks, strokes and other causes linked to tobacco use at higher rates than white smokers do, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And 85 percent of Black smokers use Newport, Kool and other menthol brands that are easier to become addicted to and harder to quit than plain tobacco, according to the Food and Drug Administration.“Covid-19 exposed the discriminatory treatment that Black people have been facing for hundreds of years,” said Dr. Phillip Gardiner, a co-chairman of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, which has been pushing for menthol bans in communities across the country. Calling menthol cigarettes and cigarillos “main vectors” of disease and death among Black Americans, he added, “It’s precisely at this time that we need strong public health measures.”There is now growing momentum in Congress to enact a ban. In states and municipalities across the country, Black public health activists have been organizing support and getting new laws passed at the state and local level. Public opposition among white parents to all flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol, has brought new resources to the issue. And the F.D.A. is under a court order to respond to a citizens’ petition to ban menthol by April 29.Advocates are hoping that President Biden, whose campaign had strong support from Black voters and who has put addressing health inequities front and center among his goals, will soon come out in favor of a ban.“I have no doubt that it’s time for a ban on menthol,” said Representative Karen Bass, of California, who led the Congressional Black Caucus during the last Congress. “We should never allow a chemical that is specifically targeted to a population, that increases death, no matter who it is. In this case, it’s menthol and the Black population. I’m so excited that we have an administration that puts racial equity and health disparities at top of its agenda.”Kevin Munoz, a spokesman for the White House, declined to say whether Mr. Biden supported a menthol ban, but he noted the president’s past support for tobacco control measures.“We are thinking about all of our options that could help reduce tobacco use and address persistent disparities,” Mr. Munoz said.Dr. Gardiner and other public health advocates are particularly concerned about the growing popularity of menthol cigars and cigarillos among Black teenagers. The 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey, conducted by the federal government, found that 6.5 percent of Black students in high school and middle school, smoked cigars and cigarillos compared with 2.5 percent who smoked traditional cigarettes. The F.D.A. says that menthol is the preferred flavor for the cigarillos, which are cheap and mass-produced, unlike premium cigars.Menthol is a substance found in mint plants, and it can also be synthesized in a lab. It creates a cooling sensation in tobacco products and masks the harshness of the smoke, making it more tolerable. Some studies have shown that menthol also acts as a mild anesthetic. Back in 1953, when menthol was not widely used, a Philip Morris Co. survey revealed that 2 percent of white smokers preferred a menthol brand, while 5 percent of Black smokers did, according to a review of tobacco industry documents by Dr. Gardiner that was published in 2004 by the medical journal Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research.“The industry looked at that and said, ‘We’re missing an opportunity,’ and consciously targeted the African-American community,” said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which has long lobbied for a menthol ban and also helps fund the African American Tobacco Leadership Council.What followed has been well-documented in records made public from numerous lawsuits, that tobacco companies have targeted Black communities with menthol cigarettes for decades. They distributed free samples, offered discounts and sponsored countless concerts and special events, among them the famous Kool Jazz Festival. Tobacco companies also gained good will by advertising in newspapers and magazines geared to a Black readership — and by donating money to civil rights organizations.The companies have also been frequent donors to Black political candidates, and they have been generous supporters of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. Officials with Juul and Altria, which owns Philip Morris and also has a 35 percent stake in Juul, serve on the foundation’s corporate advisory board.The Biden administration still lacks a permanent F.D.A. commissioner, and Dr. Janet Woodcock, the acting commissioner, has not been vocal on tobacco issues. But public health advocates were heartened by the confirmation on Thursday of Xavier Becerra, the former attorney general of California, as the secretary of health and human services. In California, Mr. Becerra took aggressive action against tobacco and e-cigarette companies. In August, California became the second state — after Massachusetts’ lead — to ban the sale of all flavored tobacco products. (The law is on hold, pending an industry-sponsored referendum to repeal it, which will be on the ballot in November 2022.)The tobacco industry is in a tricky spot. For several years, the largest companies, Altria and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, now owned by British American Tobacco, have sought to position themselves as transforming their companies into responsible businesses being eager to to preventing young people from smoking and to developing less harmful products. For critics, the industry’s lobbying to protect its menthol brands contradicts that assertion.“It doesn’t seem very transformative if you’ve taken zero steps to address a particular product that has so disproportionately and detrimentally harmed Black Americans,” said Maura Healey, the attorney general of Massachusetts, which enacted a ban on flavors, including menthol, in June. “It’s time for the F.D.A. to act on the scientific evidence that is out there.”The number of Americans who smoke cigarettes has declined to 14 percent in 2019 from a peak of 40 percent in the mid-1960s, according to the F.D.A. That translates to an estimated 34.1 million adult smokers in the United States, nearly 20 million of whom smoke menthol cigarettes. Roughly 480,000 Americans die each year from tobacco-related illnesses and more than 16 million Americans live with a smoking-related disease. In 2009, Congress gave the F.D.A. the authority to regulate the tobacco industry. That year, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act banned all intentionally flavored cigarettes except menthol, which it referred to the F.D.A. for further study. The F.D.A. came close to a ban under the Obama administration but did not have sufficient White House support.In 2018, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the first F.D.A. commissioner of the Trump administration, announced the agency would ban menthol cigarettes. He was immediately opposed by Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, one of the few unapologetically pro-tobacco lawmakers left in Congress.Mr. Burr often promotes the jobs that the industry provides in his home state. His sons have two of those jobs: Tyler Burr works in state governmental affairs at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., and William Burr works in regulatory affairs at Altria, which owns Philip Morris.After the announcement, Mr. Burr started dispatching oversight letters to the F.D.A. every Friday from mid-November 2018 through early January 2019, with the exception of the week of Thanksgiving. Emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show the hundreds of minute questions from Mr. Burr that tied up staff for weeks. He also demanded personal travel records for the agency’s seven center directors and accused the F.D.A. of leaks.The F.D.A. did not back down, but Mr. Burr helped to persuade the Trump administration to kill the plan in early 2019, according to former White House officials. Mr. Burr’s office declined to comment. David Sutton, a spokesman for Altria, which makes Marlboro and other brands that come in menthol, defended keeping menthol cigarettes on the market.“Prohibition and criminalization of adult behavior does not work for products intended for adults 21-plus,” Mr. Sutton said.Kaelan Hollon, a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds, whose Newport brand is the biggest menthol seller in the United States, said a menthol ban would infringe on the rights of adults who preferred it to plain tobacco.But such arguments ignore the fact that most smokers start the habit and become addicted to nicotine when they are young, and are most likely to seek flavored products, according to the F.D.A.At this point, the F.D.A. could again propose a federal ban, which would then have to be approved by the White House. Alternatively, Congress could adopt legislation expanding the current restrictions on sales of flavored cigarettes to include menthol — effectively undoing the current exemption.More than 120 localities have already enacted bans of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council is running an anti-menthol campaign with Delta Sigma Theta, a historically Black sorority, and others. The council is also a plaintiff, along with the Action on Smoking and Health, in the citizens’ petition that forced the April 29 deadline for the F.D.A. to say whether or not it will ban menthol.The Center for Black Health and Equity, a nonprofit organization in North Carolina, has also pushed hard on the issue, enlisting churches to sponsor “No Menthol Sundays.”In recent years, the tobacco industry has joined forces with certain civil rights activists, among them the Rev. Al Sharpton, who according to the California Department of Public Health, visited Black communities in the state, raising fear that a menthol ban would give the police an excuse to stop and frisk more Black individuals. Mr. Sharpton also helped to defeat a ban in New York.Ms. Bass has lost patience with that argument, saying a ban would prohibit selling menthol cigarettes, not possessing them.Ms. Bass said that a majority of lawmakers, including those in the Congressional Black Caucus, favor banning all tobacco flavors, including menthol. Eighty percent of the Congressional Black Caucus members voted last year for legislation that would have banned menthol cigarettes.Marc Scheineson, a lawyer with Alston and Bird, who represents small tobacco companies, believes that Representative James Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, may be the decisive vote. Mr. Clyburn was instrumental in developing support for Mr. Biden among Black Americans during his presidential campaign.“He can get whatever he wants,” Mr. Scheineson said. “I’m sure he’s got a wish list, but I’m sure all the African-American groups are coming to him and he’s got to prioritize.”Last year, Mr. Clyburn was absent for the House vote on legislation that would have banned menthol cigarettes. He has kept a low profile on the issue, not lobbying for tobacco companies but not standing in the way, either. Mr. Clyburn did not return requests seeking comment.Dr. Gottlieb believes the Biden administration will finally ban menthol cigarettes.“We opened the door on this in a Republican administration,” he said. “You don’t think a Democratic administration will finish the business? Of course they will.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>During a surge in attacks on Asian-Americans last spring, Andrew Yang — then recently off the 2020 presidential campaign trail — wrote an op-ed suggesting that “we Asian-Americans need to embrace and show our Americanness in ways we never have before.”To many Asian-Americans, the message seemed to place yet another burden on victims, and it stung.One year later, as Mr. Yang hopes to make history as New York City’s first Asian-American mayor, some New Yorkers have not forgotten that op-ed, or their sense that Mr. Yang’s remarks during the presidential campaign — describing himself as “an Asian man who likes math,” for instance — could feed stereotypical tropes.But many Asian-Americans also see in his candidacy an opportunity for representation at the highest level of city government, an increasingly meaningful metric amid violent attacks on Asian-Americans in New York and across the nation, including the fatal shootings in the Atlanta area last week that left eight people dead, six of them women of Asian descent.“I grew up Asian-American in New York, and I was always accustomed to a certain level of bullying, of racism, but it took a form of mockery, of invisibility, of disdain,” an emotional Mr. Yang said at a news conference in Times Square the next day. “That has metastasized into something far darker. You can feel it on the streets of New York.”As New York’s diverse Asian-American constituencies grapple with both overt violence — the city saw three more anti-Asian attacks on Sunday — and more subtle forms of bigotry, Mr. Yang and many of the other leading mayoral candidates are racing to show how they would lead a community in crisis. They are holding news conferences, contacting key leaders and attending rallies in solidarity with Asian-Americans who have at once demonstrated growing political power and are experiencing great pain now.But more than any other candidate, it is Mr. Yang who is in the spotlight, with the moment emerging as the most significant test yet of his ability to demonstrate leadership and empathy under pressure. He is also looking to respond in a way that will strengthen his support among Asian-Americans, a group whose backing he is counting on, while simultaneously building a broader coalition.In recent weeks, Mr. Yang has visited a branch of Xi’an Famous Foods, a popular New York restaurant chain that has been hit hard by anti-Asian harassment. Along with other contenders he joined a rally against Asian-American hate in Manhattan late last month and participated in a vigil on Friday and other outreach efforts over the weekend.“We have to start building bonds of connection with the Asian-American community to let them know that this city is theirs, this city is ours,” Mr. Yang said at a rally on Sunday. “One great way to do that is by electing the first Asian-American mayor in the history of New York City. Because you know I’ll take it seriously.”Throughout the race he has made frequent visits to heavily Asian-American neighborhoods across the city, expanding his coalition of “Yang Gang” supporters, a cohort that in his 2020 campaign included many young, white men. He has also taken multiple turns on national television to discuss attacks on Asian-Americans, including an appearance with his wife, Evelyn, on ABC’s “20/20” on Friday. Mr. Yang was not, however, the first contender to condemn the Georgia shootings, tweeting late that night instead about a St. Patrick’s Day scarf, in a move that struck some observers as tone deaf. (He later said that he had not seen the news on Tuesday. He issued a series of tweets about Atlanta on Wednesday morning, before making public remarks.)On Thursday, Mr. Yang’s voice appeared to waver with emotion as he spoke at an event convened by the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader. Speaking in starkly personal terms, Mr. Yang discussed the importance of “seeing that Asian-Americans are human beings, Asian-Americans are just as American as anyone else.”“I’m glad that he’s leaning in,” said Representative Grace Meng, the only Asian-American member of New York’s congressional delegation. “I felt like he was getting a little emotional. And I think that the Asian-American community likes to see more of that.”Jo-Ann Yoo, the executive director of New York’s Asian American Federation, said there were signs that Mr. Yang was connecting in particular with younger Asian-American voters.“They’ve said, well, nobody has invited us, drawn us into politics, we don’t see ourselves reflected in any of these spaces,” she said. “If those are the reasons Asian-American young people are not engaging, I think Yang’s done a pretty good job of leading the conversations and drawing young people in.”But, she added, “Other non-Asian candidates should not assume that Asians only vote for Asians.”Interviews with around a dozen community leaders, elected officials and voters suggest that the candidates who are best-known to Asian-American New Yorkers include Mr. Yang, a son of Taiwanese immigrants, and two veteran city officials: Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, and Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller.“It’s really a test of whether people are going to lean into longer-term relationships with electeds like Eric and Scott, or are they going to base their decision, especially the newer voters, on more identity politics, like with Andrew Yang?” said Ms. Meng, who has not endorsed a candidate.Some also mentioned interest in candidates including Maya D. Wiley, the former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio; Dianne Morales, who has relationships with community leaders from her time as a nonprofit executive; and Councilman Carlos Menchaca, a low-polling contender who represents a significant Asian-American population in Brooklyn. Ms. Meng also described Kathryn Garcia, a former city sanitation commissioner, as being especially proactive in her outreach.Like every other constituency in New York, the Asian-American slice of the electorate encompasses a diversity of views on high-priority issues including education, the economy, poverty and health care. But community leaders say that the matters of security and confronting bias have plainly become among the most urgent, though there are differences of opinion around the role policing should play in combating the uptick in attacks.“Especially during these times, it’s really important to be that candidate to show that you can empathize with the Asian-American community, that you’re reaching out actively to the community and you’re thinking of ways to bring different coalitions together,” Ms. Meng said.In Queens, the borough with the largest population of people of Asian descent, Mr. Yang’s greatest competition for those voters appears to be Mr. Adams, a former police officer who has been vocal in calling for more resources to combat anti-Asian attacks, and who is widely seen as a strong mayoral contender despite trailing Mr. Yang in the little public polling that is available.“Eric seems to have engaged in the broadest level of outreach in communities across the city, in particular, in Asian-American communities,” said State Senator John C. Liu of Queens, an influential voice in New York Asian-American politics.Asked about Mr. Yang’s outreach, he replied, “I’m going to limit my comments to things I will positively say about specific candidates.”“You can use that as my response to your specific question,” he added.The parents of Wenjian Liu, a police officer who was fatally shot in a patrol car in Brooklyn in 2014, endorsed Mr. Adams on Sunday.“Eric Adams was there for us when we lost our son — and he’s always been there for the Asian community, not just when he decided to run for mayor,” Wei Tang Liu and Xiu Yan Li said in a statement provided by the Adams campaign.It’s a message that some may see as a swipe at Mr. Yang, who has lived in New York City for years — building a career in the nonprofit and start-up worlds — but has not been active in local politics until now.At the rally against Asian-American hate late last month, Jessica Zhao, 36, said she felt torn about his candidacy. She approved of his outreach to Asian-American voters as a mayoral candidate, but she remained concerned by last spring’s op-ed, in which Mr. Yang offered a wide range of recommendations — including advising that Asian-Americans should wear red, white and blue.Indeed, Ms. Zhao had outfitted her husband — a Navy veteran — with masks bearing the military logo out of a “desperate” concern for his safety. But she detested the notion that proof of patriotism might ward off hate crimes, and was deeply bothered that, in her view, Mr. Yang seemed to put the onus for safety on Asian-Americans under attack.“To put even more of a burden on us — we could do even more to supposedly pacify racists enough that they won’t attack us? — really hit a nerve,” said Ms. Zhao, who is active with the Forest Hills Asian Association in Queens. “To say that he felt ashamed to be Asian, it was like the opposite of what we needed in that moment. We were so desperately hoping he could be a galvanizing voice for us.”In an interview last week, Mr. Yang declined to say whether he regretted writing the op-ed, but said repeatedly that he was “pained” by how it was perceived.“It pained me greatly that people felt I was somehow calling our Americanness into question when really my feeling was the opposite,” said Mr. Yang, who also pledged to be more active in New York’s Asian-American communities. “Which was, we are just as American as everyone else, and then, how can we help our people in this time when there is so much need and deprivation?”Asked whether he had changed how he approached matters of race and identity since running for president, he paused.“This is a very difficult time,” Mr. Yang finally said. “Our sense of who we are in this country has changed appreciably in the last number of months.”And in the last few weeks, Ms. Zhao’s sense of Mr. Yang has changed, too, she said.“Seeing his, I guess, evolution, in being able to properly address anti-Asian sentiment in this country, that has been encouraging,” she said. “I can tell that he brings a unique perspective of what Asians are suffering through. And that’s when representation really does come through. That’s when it does matter.”Jeffery C. Mays contributed reporting.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON — The United States placed sanctions on top Chinese officials on Monday, as part of a multinational effort to punish Beijing for human rights abuses against the largely Muslim Uyghur minority group, which American officials have called a genocide.The penalties — in coordination with the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada — come days after the Biden administration’s heated encounter with Chinese officials in Alaska, and will most likely widen tensions between Washington and Beijing.“Amid growing international condemnation, the P.R.C. continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity” in its western Xinjiang region, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in a statement on Monday, referring to the People’s Republic of China.“The United States reiterates its calls on the P.R.C. to bring an end to the repression of Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, including by releasing all those arbitrarily held in internment camps and detention facilities,” he added.The United States imposed penalties on Wang Junzheng, the secretary of the Party Committee of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and Chen Mingguo, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, for their roles in detaining and severely abusing Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, the Treasury Department said.The sanctions were imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, which allows the executive branch to use economic penalties to punish officials of other nations for human rights violations. The action will freeze any assets these officials hold in the United States.The U.S. move came hours after the European Union, United Kingdom and Canada levied their own sanctions against Chinese officials and entities for human rights violations in Xinjiang. The European Union targeted four Chinese officials, along with the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau. The United Kingdom and Canada did the same.In response to the European Union action on Monday, Chinese officials imposed sanctions on 10 Europeans, including members of the European Parliament.“This move, based on nothing but lies and disinformation, disregards and distorts facts,” a representative of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement condemning the European Union action, adding that the effort “grossly interferes in China’s internal affairs” and “severely undermines China-E.U. relations.”Mr. Blinken said the joint action is an effort on the part of the United States to work “multilaterally to advance respect for human rights.” A joint statement released by the top diplomats representing the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, among others, demanded that Beijing “end its repressive practices against Uyghur Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, and to release those arbitrarily detained.”Two Western allies heavily dependent on trade with China — Australia and New Zealand — issued their own joint statement endorsing the Xinjiang-related sanctions, but stopped short of announcing their own penalties on Chinese officials.China’s crackdown on Uyghurs has included forced sterilizations and sending hundreds of thousands of people — if not a million or more — to indoctrination camps intended to instill loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party and break down adherence to Islam.In a separate action on Monday, the United States announced sanctions in coordination with the European Union that named military officials and other entities in Myanmar for their violent repression of democratic protests.The U.S. action against Beijing seems in line with the diplomatic vision set forth by Mr. Blinken and Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, in their first face-to-face meeting with Chinese officials in Alaska last week. Mr. Sullivan said the United States remained “cleareyed” about the challenges that lay ahead for the world's two largest economic and technological powers.The penalties also come on the heels of the Biden administration’s decision to place sanctions on 24 Chinese officials for undermining democratic freedoms in Hong Kong, and are in a similar vein to the Trump administration’s strategy of using sanctions as a means to punish Chinese officials for human rights abuses.Omer Kanat, the executive director of the Uyghur Human Rights Project, praised the coordinated effort by many nations to penalize Chinese officials.“Unprecedented cooperation between governments like this is how genocide will be brought to an end,” Mr. Kanat said in a statement on Monday. “This is what Uyghurs have been asking for — the dam has broken and the response has finally begun.”Ana Swanson contributed reporting.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Good morning. We’re covering the deepening global vaccine divide and a multination effort to punish China for its treatment of Uyghur Muslims.Of the Covid-19 vaccine doses given globally, roughly three-quarters have gone to only 10 countries. At least 30 countries have not yet injected a single person.Many poorer nations could wait years for their shots, a delay that scientists warn could haunt all countries if the continued spread of the coronavirus allows it to mutate in ways that undermine vaccines. Many countries were relying on the global vaccine program known as Covax, which was created around the idea that all would buy vaccines through a single mechanism, but dozens of wealthy nations went straight to pharmaceutical companies and elbowed the program out of the way.The toll: Already, unvaccinated doctors and nurses have died this year in countries including Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, depleting health systems that can ill afford to lose any more workers.Case study: Even in Kenya, one of Africa’s wealthier nations, the first vaccine shipment arrived only this month, later than anticipated and with only a quarter of the doses promised. No one knows when the next batch will arrive. In the best-case scenario, Kenya is expecting to vaccinate only 30 percent of its people, or about 16 million out of almost 50 million, by the middle of 2023.Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.In other developments:Britain, Canada, the U.S. and the European Union imposed penalties on Chinese officials on Monday over human rights abuses of Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The moves come days after a heated encounter in Alaska between U.S. and Chinese senior officials, and is likely to increase tensions between the nations and Beijing. Australia is debating a motion that would call for a U.N. inquiry and for its government to ensure that the country does not profit from forced labor in Xinjiang.The U.S. froze the assets of two Xinjiang officials and called for the release of those held in forced labor camps in the region. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China’s leadership “continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.”The E.U. targeted four officials in Xinjiang, imposing its first significant sanctions on China in more than three decades.Backlash: Beijing retaliated immediately, blacklisting 10 European officials who work on the bloc’s policy toward China. The Chinese government denies allegations of abuse and claims the camps are needed to fight extremism.On the ground: Exiled Uyghur families described being separated from their children, some as young as 5 years old, who are forced to stay in state orphanages, according to a recent Amnesty International report.Israelis are voting on Tuesday in their fourth election in just two years. Many of them feel numbed by their endless election cycle — a mood that contrasts with the Palestinians, who are excited about a rare chance to vote, in elections in May.The Israeli vote is the embodiment of political paralysis caused in part by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s efforts to remain in office while on trial for corruption. Mr. Netanyahu hopes the country’s successful Covid-19 vaccination campaign will help him win. But polls suggest that the outcome is unlikely to break the deadlock. Many Israelis are bracing for a fifth election later this year.The Palestinian vote, set for May 22, will be the first since a violent rift in 2007 between Hamas, the faction that controls the Gaza Strip, and its rival, Fatah. More than 93 percent of Palestinians have registered to vote, illustrating an initial enthusiasm for the process. Young people want a clearer path to statehood and a more competent government.Geopolitics: Mr. Netanyahu’s plans to visit the United Arab Emirates and his bombast about Emirati investments have turned into a diplomatic debacle. Emirati officials sent clear signals that the Persian Gulf country would not be drawn into Mr. Netanyahu’s re-election campaign.A Morning ReadModel trains are the latest industry getting a pandemic-spurred boost from people seeking new hobbies. With sales rising, Märklin, a 162-year-old German company, is hiring new apprentices to learn the precise art of making miniature trains. (Take a virtual tour of the factory here.)“Outside, there is total chaos,” one enthusiast said. “But inside, around my little train set, it is quiet, it is picturesque.”Covid has traumatized the U.S. Dr. Diane Meier, the director of the Center to Advance Palliative Care in New York, discussed what is needed to heal with our Talk columnist. Here’s an excerpt.Has the pandemic affected our collective attitude toward grief?There are many shadow pandemics. One is the trauma to the entire health profession during this last year. The other trauma is the roughly 10 people for every person who has died from Covid who are grieving. That’s over five million people. That is a shadow pandemic that will be with us long after we get the virus under control. Our current president has worked hard to begin to address that through the ritual ceremonies to remember the dead and honor them, and he has talked a lot about his own losses, to normalize talking about losses and how they’re with you every day. That’s important. We need other people to do it, too.Can you tease out the link you suggested earlier between trauma and killing the other?The analogy is post-traumatic stress disorder: an overreaction to new traumas because the prior traumas were never addressed, never expressed, never worked through. So everything that happens re-triggers it. There’s a book called “The Body Keeps the Score,” and that’s what it’s about: Things that happened to you years ago don’t ever go away. They are embedded in your mind and body and inform how you react to things that happen today.What to CookThis spinach soup with tahini and lemon is bright and complex.What to WatchIf you like the farce and brotherly conflicts of “Frasier,” you might like the funny, lovely British comedy “Back,” which crams more jokes and details into its episodes than some shows manage in a season.Where to Go (Virtually)Nintendo’s theme park opened in Japan last week.

       "0  For his new photo book, “Gentlemen’s Club,” Chris Buck spent six years interviewing and taking portraits of strippers and their romantic partners.“Partners of dancers are in this inherently complicated space of dating someone who’s intimate with others for their work,” he said. In that sense, the project is a study not only of labor, but also of relationships and fidelity.One question drove many of the interviews: How do you feel about your partner’s work?“You shouldn’t be doing that. Wash dishes. Be a nurse. You’re a good girl. Take care of people,” Vincent from Jersey City, who is featured on the book’s cover, says in the book. (Mr. Buck included only first names.) Vincent adds that he doesn’t like his wife’s work, but it “pays the rent.”Aaron, who is the main caregiver for two daughters, tells Mr. Buck he has struggled with his wife’s career. However, he says, “I get to spend all of my time with my girls, and it’s funded by her dancing.”Others fully embrace the work. “I know that I’m the one that gets to go home with her at night,” says Haylie, a veterinary technician who lives in Baltimore. Besides working as a stripper, Haylie’s partner is a dominatrix, sex therapist and advice columnist.For many, Mr. Buck, 56, was the first person to pose the question. “A number of times, the partner would say, ‘My wife or girlfriend encouraged me to talk to you because they know I have no one else to talk to about this,’” Mr. Buck said. “It was framed as kind of therapeutic.”Petr Sorfa, 52, lives in Portland, Ore., with his wife, Berlin, 39, who is open about her marital status with clients. Sometimes Mr. Sorfa visits her at the club.“If someone finds out you’re a stripper husband, they’re like, ‘wow’ or ‘how?’ They’re just interested in my wife,” Mr. Sorfa said in a phone interview for this article. “Even close friends wouldn’t ask me anything about it. Our parents know, and they haven’t said anything or asked anything.”For the Sorfas, participating in Mr. Buck’s project was a chance to add another dimension to media portrayals of strippers and their families. “They don’t expect a normal person to be a husband of a stripper,” Mr. Sorfa said.Ms. Sorfa said that there isn’t much “honest coverage” about the lives of people like her. “I think there’s a reason for that,” she said. “It kills the fantasy when you’re a whole person. It’s harder to fetishize someone when they’re whole and they’re like you.”Talonn Medley, 31, said that speaking for the book was an opportunity to “get rid of the stigma that strippers have no morals, come from a broken home, are cheap and dirty,” he said in a phone interview. He and his ex-wife met while both were working as dancers in nearby clubs in Portland, Ore. Now he lives in Springfield, Mo., with his husband and a son from his previous marriage, and is enrolled in a pre-med program; he has stopped stripping.“The more I speak about what my life actually was like, the more I can change people’s mind-sets,” he said.Mr. Medley knows what it is like to be both the dancer and the partner. “You have to have these emotional relationships with dozens of people every night,” he said. “Somebody has to be strong and know themselves emotionally. Otherwise jealousy will get in the way.”Lily Burana, an author, journalist and a former stripper, wrote the foreword to the book. Ms. Burana said she tends to be skeptical of artists who want to do a “drive-by” of the lives of strippers, but Mr. Buck seemed different. “His email was perfectly professional,” she said. One “trigger” that gets people dismissed by strippers or sex workers is, Ms. Burana said, “‘I think you humanize the work.’ We were humans before you got here.”Ms. Burana has written extensively about being a stripper, and was a lead plaintiff in a major labor rights lawsuit against a strip club in the 1990s. She believes that public attitudes have shifted considerably since then.“There’s an increase in respect, increase in care taken with the material. There’s an understanding that we’re hard-working and also very vulnerable to stigma and punitive misogyny and homophobia,” she said. “When I saw the book, I really felt like things are changing for the better.”

       "1  Libertie, the rebellious heroine of Kaitlyn Greenidge’s new novel, comes from an extraordinary family, but longs to be ordinary.As a young Black woman growing up in Reconstruction-era Brooklyn, Libertie is expected to follow in the footsteps of her trailblazing mother, a doctor who founded a women’s clinic. Instead, she flunks out of college and marries her first suitor, hoping to lead a tranquil domestic life.Greenidge based her book partly on Susan Smith McKinney Steward, who in the 1870s was the first Black woman to become a doctor in New York State. As she researched the family, she found herself drawn to the doctor’s wayward daughter, Anna. She became the model for Libertie, the kind of historical figure who is rarely celebrated: someone who simply wants to survive and thrive, not to be the first or the only one of anything.“So much of Black history is focused on exceptional people,” Greenidge said in a video interview earlier this month. “Part of what I wanted to explore is, what’s the emotional and psychological toll of being an exception, of being exceptional, and also, what about the people who just want to have a regular life and find freedom and achievement in being able to live in peace with their family — which is what Libertie wants?”Greenidge comes from a family of exceptional women herself. Her sister Kerri Greenidge is a historian who specializes in African-American and African diasporic histories, literature, and politics. Her other sister, Kirsten Greenidge, is an Obie Award-winning playwright and a theater professor at Boston University. Growing up in mostly white, wealthy suburbs around Boston, raised by a single mother who struggled to support the family on her social worker’s salary, all three felt pressure to succeed in rarefied fields where they often felt like exceptions.“That idea of being the first and the only was a big piece of our experience,” Greenidge said.Since the start of the pandemic, she has been quarantining with her mother and sisters in a woodsy suburb in central Massachusetts. Occasionally, when their interests and schedules have aligned, they’ve collaborated on creative ventures, including a podcast and a history project. They are engaged in ongoing conversations about their writing, though they draw the line at reading and editing drafts of one another’s work.“My sisters and I have always been extremely close and we are each other’s greatest fans, but we have always been our own people,” Kerri said.All three have risen to prominence in their respective genres, and they have produced enough award-winning literature to fill a bookstore display. Kirsten, the oldest, has written and staged around a dozen plays, works that often explore the lives of Black women and families in the Northeast. Kerri — who teaches at Tufts University, where she is the Mellon assistant professor in the Department of Studies in Race, Colonialism, and Diaspora — has published groundbreaking books about Boston abolitionists and the Black activist William Trotter. Kaitlyn, the youngest at 39, was hailed for her 2016 debut, “We Love You, Charlie Freeman,” a novel about a Black family taking part in a morally fraught experiment by adopting a chimpanzee and teaching him sign language. (She’s also a contributing Op-Ed writer for The New York Times.)With “Libertie,” which Algonquin is publishing next week, Greenidge is making a stylistic leap with an intricately researched and lushly imagined coming-of-age story set in 19th-century Brooklyn and Jacmel, Haiti. The novel has drawn praise from writers like Jacqueline Woodson, Mira Jacob and Garth Greenwell, who wrote in a blurb that Greenidge “adds an indelible new sound to American literature, and confirms her status as one of our most gifted young writers.”“There’s a really powerful lyricism that feels new in this voice,” said the novelist Alexander Chee, who was Greenidge’s writing professor at Wesleyan.For Greenidge, writing about Black women living through social upheaval felt like a return to her long-running obsessions: questions about whose stories get told as part of American history, how trauma is passed down across generations, what it means to be free of the past.“I’ve always been interested in the histories of things that are lesser known,” she said. “If you come from a marginalized community, one of the ways you are marginalized is people telling you that you don’t have any history, or that your history is somehow diminished, or it’s very flat, or it’s not somehow as rich as the dominant history.”Greenidge and her sisters developed a reverence for storytelling and history early on, when their parents and grandparents would tell stories about their ancestors and what life was like during the civil rights movement. Their grandparents were among the first Black people to move to Arlington, Mass., and recruited a white friend to pose as the home buyer, a scenario that Kirsten drew on in her play “The Luck of the Irish.”“That connected us to a historical narrative and possibly led to all of us studying history in our ways,” Kirsten said.Their mother, Ariel, encouraged them to find creative ways to entertain themselves. So they wrote stories, played instruments and staged elaborate plays that Kirsten wrote. They recorded make-believe radio shows on a cassette player, belting out the soundtracks to “Grease,” and other musicals.Kaitlyn was a precocious reader and absorbed books far above her grade level because her sisters would read aloud from whatever they were into at the time, regardless of whether the plots were appropriate. “We scared the heck out of that poor kid,” Kirsten said.Outside of their boisterous, creative home life, the sisters were keenly aware of race and class and how it defined them in the largely white prep schools they attended. Those issues became more pronounced after their mother and father, a lawyer, divorced, when Kaitlyn was 7. Suddenly, they went from being upper middle class to sliding below the poverty line and relying on public assistance.“That fracture was really formative for me,” she said. “It made me hyper aware of inequality and the doublespeak that goes on in America around the American dream and American exceptionalism, because that was proven to me not to be true.”The change in the family’s economic status also increased the pressure the sisters felt to excel. “As young women of color in America, that was made clear to us from very early on, definitely feeling the onus of, How are you going to put your education to use?” Kirsten said.After Kaitlyn Greenidge graduated from Wesleyan, she worked as a park ranger, phone banker and researcher at historical sites, and designed a vocabulary app for an education technology company. She kept writing, publishing essays and articles and, eventually, her debut novel, which won her a Whiting Award in fiction.She got the idea for “Libertie” a decade ago, when she was working at the Weeksville Heritage Center, a museum dedicated to a free Black community that was founded in Brooklyn in 1838. Greenidge was collecting stories from people whose ancestors had lived there, and tracked down a woman named Ellen Holly, who was the first Black actress to have a lead, recurring role on daytime TV, in “One Life to Live.” Holly spoke about her great-grandmother Susan Smith McKinney Steward, whose daughter Anna married a son of the Episcopal archbishop of Haiti and moved with him to Port-au-Prince, but came to regret it.Greenidge filed the family’s saga away in her mind, thinking she had the premise for a novel. When she got a writing fellowship, she was able to quit her side jobs and immerse herself in the research the novel required. She read old newspapers, political tracts, sermons, memoirs, hymns and census records. Occasionally, she turned to Kerri — she affectionately calls her older sister a “history nerd” — for advice. “She’s a human Wikipedia,” she said. “How could you not?”The resulting story feels both epic and intimate. As she reimagined the lives of the doctor and her daughter, Greenidge wove in other historical figures and events. In one horrific scene, Libertie and her mother tend to Black families who fled Manhattan during the New York City draft riots. In the novel’s opening chapter, Libertie sees her mother revive a man who arrives at their home sealed in a coffin, brought by a woman who works on the Underground Railroad. Greenidge based the woman on Henrietta Duterte, a Black abolitionist in Philadelphia who used her funeral home to help people escape.Greenidge also drew on her own family history, and her experience of being a new mother. Her daughter, Mavis, was born days after she finished a second draft of the book, and is now 18 months old. She finished revisions while living in a multigenerational household with her own mother and sisters.“Mother-daughter relationships are like the central relationships in my life,” she said. “One of the things I was interested in was motherhood as this place of self-creation.”She took inspiration from Toni Morrison, who once described motherhood as “the most liberating thing that ever happened to me.”That idea, of motherhood as a catalyst for self-discovery, became a refrain toward the end of the novel, when Libertie reads a letter from her mother. “I cannot think of a greater freedom than raising you,” it says.Follow New York Times Books on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.

       "2  In the coming days, a patent will finally be issued on a five-year-old invention, a feat of molecular engineering that is at the heart of at least five major Covid-19 vaccines. And the United States government will control that patent.The new patent presents an opportunity — and some argue the last best chance — to exact leverage over the drug companies producing the vaccines and pressure them to expand access to less affluent countries.The question is whether the government will do anything at all.The rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines, achieved at record speed and financed by massive public funding in the United States, the European Union and Britain, represents a great triumph of the pandemic. Governments partnered with drugmakers, pouring in billions of dollars to procure raw materials, finance clinical trials and retrofit factories. Billions more were committed to buy the finished product.But this Western success has created stark inequity. Residents of wealthy and middle-income countries have received about 90 percent of the nearly 400 million vaccines delivered so far. Under current projections, many of the rest will have to wait years.Growing numbers of health officials and advocacy groups worldwide are calling for Western governments to use aggressive powers — most of them rarely or never used before — to force companies to publish vaccine recipes, share their know-how and ramp up manufacturing. Public health advocates have pleaded for help, including asking the Biden administration to use its patent to push for broader vaccine access.Governments have resisted. By partnering with drug companies, Western leaders bought their way to the front of the line. But they also ignored years of warnings — and explicit calls from the World Health Organization — to include contract language that would have guaranteed doses for poor countries or encouraged companies to share their knowledge and the patents they control.“It was like a run on toilet paper. Everybody was like, ‘Get out of my way. I’m gonna get that last package of Charmin,’” said Gregg Gonsalves, a Yale epidemiologist. “We just ran for the doses.”The prospect of billions of people waiting years to be vaccinated poses a health threat to even the richest countries. One example: In Britain, where the vaccine rollout has been strong, health officials are tracking a virus variant that emerged in South Africa, where vaccine coverage is weak. That variant may be able to blunt the effect of vaccines, meaning even vaccinated people might get sick.Western health officials said they never intended to exclude others. But with their own countries facing massive death tolls, the focus was at home. Patent sharing, they said, simply never came up.“It was U.S.-centric. It wasn’t anti-global.” said Moncef Slaoui, who was the chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, a Trump administration program that funded the search for vaccines in the United States. “Everybody was in agreement that vaccine doses, once the U.S. is served, will go elsewhere.”President Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union’s executive branch, are reluctant to change course. Mr. Biden has promised to help an Indian company produce about 1 billion doses by the end of 2022 and his administration has donated doses to Mexico and Canada. But he has made it clear that his focus is at home.“We’re going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of first,” Mr. Biden said recently. “But we’re then going to try and help the rest of the world.”Pressuring companies to share patents could be seen as undermining innovation, sabotaging drugmakers or picking drawn-out and expensive fights with the very companies digging a way out of the pandemic.As rich countries fight to keep things as they are, others like South Africa and India have taken the battle to the World Trade Organization, seeking a waiver on patent restrictions for Covid-19 vaccines.Russia and China, meanwhile, have promised to fill the void as part of their vaccine diplomacy. The Gamaleya Institute in Moscow, for example, has entered into partnerships with producers from Kazakhstan to South Korea, according to data from Airfinity, a science analytics company, and UNICEF. Chinese vaccine makers have reached similar deals in the United Arab Emirates, Brazil and Indonesia.Addressing patents would not, by itself, solve the vaccine imbalance. Retrofitting or constructing factories would take time. More raw materials would need to be manufactured. Regulators would have to approve new assembly lines.And as with cooking a complicated dish, giving someone a list of ingredients is no substitute to showing them how to make it.To address these problems, the World Health Organization created a technology pool last year to encourage companies to share know-how with manufacturers in lower-income nations.Not a single vaccine company has signed up.“The problem is that the companies don’t want to do it. And the government is just not very tough with the companies,” said James Love, who leads Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit.Drug company executives told European lawmakers recently that they were licensing their vaccines as quickly as possible, but that finding partners with the right technology was challenging.“They don’t have the equipment,” Moderna’s chief executive, Stéphane Bancel, said. “There is no capacity.”But manufacturers from Canada to Bangladesh say they can make vaccines — they just lack patent licensing deals. When the price is right, companies have shared secrets with new manufacturers in just months, ramping up production and retrofitting factories.It helps when the government sweetens the deal. Earlier this month, Mr. Biden announced that the pharmaceutical giant Merck would help make vaccines for its competitor Johnson & Johnson. The government pressured Johnson & Johnson to accept the help and is using wartime procurement powers to secure supplies for the company. It will also pay to retrofit Merck’s production line, with an eye toward making vaccines available to every adult in the United States by May.Despite the hefty government funding, drug companies control nearly all of the intellectual property and stand to make fortunes off the vaccines. A critical exception is the patent expected to be approved soon — a government-led discovery for manipulating a key coronavirus protein.This breakthrough, at the center of the 2020 race for a vaccine, actually came years earlier in a National Institutes of Health lab, where an American scientist named Dr. Barney Graham was in pursuit of a medical moonshot.For years, Dr. Graham specialized in the kind of long, expensive research that only governments bankroll. He searched for a key to unlock universal vaccines — genetic blueprints to be used against any of the roughly two dozen viral families that infect humans. When a new virus emerged, scientists could simply tweak the code and quickly make a vaccine.In 2016, while working on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, another coronavirus known as MERS, he and his colleagues developed a way to swap a pair of amino acids in the coronavirus spike protein. That bit of molecular engineering, they realized, could be used to develop effective vaccines against any coronavirus. The government, along with its partners at Dartmouth College and the Scripps Research Institute, filed for a patent, which will be issued this month.When Chinese scientists published the genetic code of the new coronavirus in January 2020, Dr. Graham’s team had their cookbook ready.“We kind of knew exactly what we had to do,” said Jason McLellan, one of the inventors, who now works at the University of Texas at Austin. “We’d already done everything.”Dr. Graham was already working with Moderna on a vaccine for another virus when the outbreak in China inspired his team to change focus. “We just flipped it to coronavirus and said, ‘How fast can we go?’” Dr. Graham recalled.Within a few days, they emailed the vaccine’s genetic blueprint to Moderna to begin manufacturing. By late February, Moderna had produced enough vaccines for government-run clinical trials.“We did the front end. They did the middle. And we did the back end,” Dr. Graham said.Exactly who holds patents for which vaccines won’t be sorted out for months or years. But it is clear now that several of today’s vaccines — including those from Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, CureVac and Pfizer-BioNTech — rely on the 2016 invention. Of those, only BioNTech has paid the U.S. government to license the technology. The patent is scheduled to be issued March 30.Patent lawyers and public health advocates say it’s likely that other companies will either have to negotiate a licensing agreement with the government, or face the prospect of a lawsuit worth billions. The government filed such a lawsuit in 2019 against the drugmaker Gilead over H.I.V. medication.This gives the Biden administration leverage to force companies to share technology and expand worldwide production, said Christopher J. Morten, a New York University law professor specializing in medical patents.“We can do this the hard way, where we sue you for patent infringement,” he said the government could assert. “Or just play nice with us and license your tech.”The National Institutes of Health declined to comment on its discussions with the drugmakers but said it did not anticipate a dispute over patent infringement. None of the drug companies responded to repeated questions about the 2016 patent.Experts said the government has stronger leverage on the Moderna vaccine, which was almost entirely funded by taxpayers. New mRNA vaccines, such as those from Moderna, are relatively easier to manufacture than vaccines that rely on live viruses. Scientists compare it to an old-fashioned cassette player: Try one tape. If it’s not right, just pop in another.Moderna expects $18.4 billion in vaccine sales this year, but it is the delivery system — the cassette player — that is its most prized secret. Disclosing it could mean giving away the key to the company’s future.By last spring, with the Moderna vaccine in its earliest trials, vaccine science had clearly become a nationalistic competition. World leaders joined the W.H.O. in April to raise $8 billion for Covid-19 vaccines, tests and treatments, but China and the United States were notably absent.“There should be no division in order to win this battle,” President Emmanuel Macron of France said.Yet European governments had backed their own champions. The European Investment Bank lent nearly $120 million to BioNTech, a German company, and Germany bought a $360 million stake in the biotech firm CureVac after reports that it was being lured to the United States.“We funded the research, on both sides of the Atlantic,” said Udo Bullmann, a German member of the European Parliament. “You could have agreed on a paragraph that says ‘You are obliged to give it to poor countries in a way that they can afford it.’ Of course you could have.”In May, the leaders of Pakistan, Ghana, South Africa and others called for governments to support a “people’s vaccine” that could be quickly manufactured and given for free.They urged the governing body of the World Health Organization to treat vaccines as “global public goods.”Though such a declaration would have had no teeth, the Trump administration moved swiftly to block it. Intent on protecting intellectual property, the government said calls for equitable access to vaccines and treatments sent “the wrong message to innovators.”World leaders ultimately approved a watered-down declaration that recognized extensive immunization — not the vaccines themselves — as a global public good.That same month, the World Health Organization launched the technology-access pool and called on governments to include clauses in their drug contracts guaranteeing equitable distribution. But the world’s richest nations roundly ignored the call.In the United States, Operation Warp Speed went on a summertime spending spree, disbursing over $10 billion to handpicked companies and absorbing the financial risks of bringing a vaccine to market.“Our role was to enable the private sector to be successful,” said Paul Mango, a top adviser to the then health secretary, Alex M. Azar II.The deals came with few strings attached.Large chunks of the contracts are redacted and some remain secret. But public records show that the government used unusual contracts that omitted its right to take over intellectual property or influence the price and availability of vaccines. They did not let the government compel companies to share their technology.British and other European leaders made similar concessions as they ordered enough doses to vaccinate their populations multiple times over.“You have to write the rules of the game, and the place to do that would have been these funding contracts,” said Ellen ’t Hoen, the director of Medicines Law and Policy, an international research group.By comparison, one of the world’s largest health financiers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, includes grant language requiring equitable access to vaccines. As leverage, the organization retains some right to the intellectual property.Dr. Slaoui, who came to Warp Speed after leading research and development at GlaxoSmithKline, is sympathetic to this idea. But it would have been impractical to demand patent concessions and still deliver on the program’s primary goals of speed and volume, he said.“I can guarantee you that the agreements with the companies would have been much more complex and taken a much longer time,” he said. The European Union, for example, haggled over price and liability provisions, which delayed the rollout.In some ways, this was a trip down a trodden path. When the H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic broke out in 2009, the wealthiest countries cornered the global vaccine market and all but locked out the rest of the world.Experts said at the time that this was a chance to rethink the approach. But the swine flu pandemic fizzled and governments ended up destroying the vaccines they had hoarded. They then forgot to prepare for the future.For months, the United States and European Union have blocked a proposal at the World Trade Organization that would waive intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. The application, put forward by South Africa and India with support from most developing nations, has been bogged down in procedural hearings.“Every minute we are deadlocked in the negotiating room, people are dying,” said Mustaqeem De Gama, a South African diplomat who is involved in the talks.But in Brussels and Washington, leaders are still worried about undermining innovation.During the presidential campaign, Mr. Biden’s team gathered top intellectual property lawyers to discuss ways to increase vaccine production.“They were planning on taking the international view on things,” said Ana Santos Rutschman, a Saint Louis University law professor who participated in the sessions.Most of the options were politically thorny. Among them was the use of a federal law allowing the government to seize a company’s patent and give it to another in order to increase supply. Former campaign advisers say the Biden camp was lukewarm to this proposal and others that called for a broader exercise of its powers.The administration has instead promised to give $4 billion to Covax, the global vaccine alliance. The European Union has given nearly $1 billion so far. But Covax aims to vaccinate only 20 percent of people in the world’s poorest countries this year, and faces a $2 billion shortfall even to accomplish that.Dr. Graham, the N.I.H. scientist whose team cracked the coronavirus vaccine code for Moderna, said that pandemic preparedness and vaccine development should be international collaborations, not competitions.“A lot of this would not have happened unless there was a big infusion of government money,” he said.But governments cannot afford to sabotage companies that need profit to survive.Dr. Graham has largely moved on from studying the coronavirus. He is searching for a universal flu vaccine, a silver bullet that could prevent all strains of the disease without an annual tweak.Though he was vaccinated through work, he spent the early part of the year trying to get his wife and grown children onto waiting lists — an ordeal that even one of the key inventors had to endure. “You can imagine how aggravating that is,” he said.Matina Stevis-Gridneff and Monika Pronczuk contributed reporting.   \n",
       "3  Canadian-Chinese tensions worsened Monday as China put a former Canadian diplomat on trial on spying charges, the second such trial in recent days, while Canada sanctioned four Chinese officials and one state entity for human-rights violations against the Uyghur minority.A court in Beijing held the trial of the former diplomat, Michael Kovrig, who was detained by the Chinese authorities in late 2018, shortly after Canada arrested a top executive at the Chinese technology firm Huawei at the request of the United States.The trial was conducted in secret, with the Chinese authorities barring foreign diplomats and journalists from attending. In a show of support for Mr. Kovrig, more than two dozen diplomats representing several countries, including Canada and the United States, tried to gain access to the courtroom, only to be turned away by security personnel.Government officials, legal scholars and human rights activists denounced China’s decision to hold the trial, just days after another Canadian, Michael Spavor, a businessman who was also detained in 2018, appeared before a court in Dandong, a northeastern city. Critics have described the trials as a sham meant as retaliation for the arrest of the Huawei executive, and accuse China of resorting to “hostage diplomacy.”“We are deeply troubled by the total lack of transparency surrounding these hearings and we continue to work toward an immediate end to their arbitrary detention,” the Canadian foreign minister, Marc Garneau, said in a statement.In Canada, the trials have reinforced an already simmering backlash against China, and are pushing the country to re-evaluate its relations with Beijing. In a sign of Canada’s determination to hold China accountable on human rights, Canada joined the United States, the European Union and Britain on Monday to impose sanctions against four Chinese officials and one Chinese state entity involved in repressing China’s Uyghur population in the northwestern Xinjiang region.In February, Canada’s House of Commons voted overwhelmingly to call China’s treatment of the Uyghurs a genocide, while Ottawa has also criticized China’s clampdown in Hong Kong. According to a recent poll by the Angus Reid Institute, a leading polling company, only 14 percent of Canadians have a favorable view of China.“China’s recent moves — hostage-taking of Canadians, threatening allies such as Australia, hacking away at Hong Kong autonomy, questioning the delicate balance in Taiwan and scaring the neighbors with muscle-flexing — are driving Canada to seek a closer alignment with the U.S.,” The Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper, said in an editorial, urging Canada to roll back its economic dependence on China.The detention of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor appears to be part of an effort by China to win the release of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei and the daughter of the company’s founder. Ms. Meng faces sweeping fraud charges in the United States, which is seeking her extradition.China on Monday defended its decision to go forward with the trial of Mr. Kovrig. The court in Beijing said in a brief statement that he was tried on charges of “gathering state secrets and intelligence for foreign countries” and that a verdict would be announced at a later date.In combative remarks, Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, rejected criticism that the trials should be open to the public and accused Canada of acting as an accomplice to American efforts to undermine China.“This is a political incident through and through,” Ms. Hua said at a news conference in Beijing, referring to Ms. Meng’s case.The prosecutions of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor have unfolded against a backdrop of growing tensions over China’s increasingly assertive behavior on the global stage.American officials on Monday denounced China’s decision to go forward with the trials, saying they were inconsistent with international human rights agreements.“The charges are a blatant attempt to use human beings as bargaining leverage,” a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Beijing said in a statement. “The practice of arbitrary detention to exercise leverage over foreign governments is completely unacceptable.”The Biden administration is working to build coalitions of countries to counter China’s strength and limit its transgressions, including on human rights issues.But China’s authoritarian leader, Xi Jinping, appears increasingly unbothered by the threat of international condemnation, and his government seems eager to demonstrate it will not bow to demands from the United States.At a meeting last week in Alaska, American officials raised the detentions of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor with their Chinese counterparts, according to a senior Biden administration official. The Americans also expressed concerns about the exclusion of foreign diplomats from the trials. The talks identified areas of sharp disagreements as well as what Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken described as intersecting interests, although ultimately the two sides left without a joint statement of their willingness to work together.“Beijing has shown time and time again that it frankly does not care what the international community disapproves of,” said Diana Fu, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto. “It is playing by its own rules, like it or not.”While verdicts have not yet been announced in the cases of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor, both men are likely to be convicted. Chinese courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party, and convictions are almost certain, especially in cases involving national security. During court proceedings, there are limited opportunities to examine evidence or hear rebuttals.Chinese courts typically shroud such cases in secrecy so that the authorities can maximize control over the outcomes, said Joshua Rosenzweig, head of Amnesty International’s China team.“Whatever the results for Kovrig and Spavor,” Mr. Rosenzweig said, “China will want to keep everything under wraps to ensure that it has as much control over the narrative as possible.”Mr. Kovrig has detailed the difficult conditions he faces in prison to family during the few times he has been allowed to speak with them. He has said that he has been confined to a small jail cell in Beijing and subjected to repeated interrogations. His diet has, at times, been restricted to rice and boiled vegetables.His friends and former co-workers on Monday reiterated calls for his release, saying China, Canada and the United States should redouble efforts to resolve the issue.“This is a political case, not a legal one,” said Richard Atwood, interim president of the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based research organization where Mr. Kovrig worked as an adviser. “Anyone with the power to end this unjust, arbitrary detention should do whatever is possible to do so.”Mr. Kovrig’s wife, Vina Nadjibulla, said in an interview that she hoped international support for Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor would help bring about their release.“Michael shouldn’t have been there to begin with,” she said. “This has been an unjust and arbitrary detention since day one and Monday’s trial didn’t change that fact.”Dan Bilefsky and Lara Jakes contributed reporting.

       "4  The banning of menthol cigarettes, the mint-flavored products that have been aggressively marketed to Black Americans, has long been an elusive goal for public health regulators.But Covid-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement have put new pressure on Congress and the White House to reduce racial health disparities. And there are few starker examples than this: Black smokers smoke less but die of heart attacks, strokes and other causes linked to tobacco use at higher rates than white smokers do, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And 85 percent of Black smokers use Newport, Kool and other menthol brands that are easier to become addicted to and harder to quit than plain tobacco, according to the Food and Drug Administration.“Covid-19 exposed the discriminatory treatment that Black people have been facing for hundreds of years,” said Dr. Phillip Gardiner, a co-chairman of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, which has been pushing for menthol bans in communities across the country. Calling menthol cigarettes and cigarillos “main vectors” of disease and death among Black Americans, he added, “It’s precisely at this time that we need strong public health measures.”There is now growing momentum in Congress to enact a ban. In states and municipalities across the country, Black public health activists have been organizing support and getting new laws passed at the state and local level. Public opposition among white parents to all flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol, has brought new resources to the issue. And the F.D.A. is under a court order to respond to a citizens’ petition to ban menthol by April 29.Advocates are hoping that President Biden, whose campaign had strong support from Black voters and who has put addressing health inequities front and center among his goals, will soon come out in favor of a ban.“I have no doubt that it’s time for a ban on menthol,” said Representative Karen Bass, of California, who led the Congressional Black Caucus during the last Congress. “We should never allow a chemical that is specifically targeted to a population, that increases death, no matter who it is. In this case, it’s menthol and the Black population. I’m so excited that we have an administration that puts racial equity and health disparities at top of its agenda.”Kevin Munoz, a spokesman for the White House, declined to say whether Mr. Biden supported a menthol ban, but he noted the president’s past support for tobacco control measures.“We are thinking about all of our options that could help reduce tobacco use and address persistent disparities,” Mr. Munoz said.Dr. Gardiner and other public health advocates are particularly concerned about the growing popularity of menthol cigars and cigarillos among Black teenagers. The 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey, conducted by the federal government, found that 6.5 percent of Black students in high school and middle school, smoked cigars and cigarillos compared with 2.5 percent who smoked traditional cigarettes. The F.D.A. says that menthol is the preferred flavor for the cigarillos, which are cheap and mass-produced, unlike premium cigars.Menthol is a substance found in mint plants, and it can also be synthesized in a lab. It creates a cooling sensation in tobacco products and masks the harshness of the smoke, making it more tolerable. Some studies have shown that menthol also acts as a mild anesthetic. Back in 1953, when menthol was not widely used, a Philip Morris Co. survey revealed that 2 percent of white smokers preferred a menthol brand, while 5 percent of Black smokers did, according to a review of tobacco industry documents by Dr. Gardiner that was published in 2004 by the medical journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research.“The industry looked at that and said, ‘We’re missing an opportunity,’ and consciously targeted the African-American community,” said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, which has long lobbied for a menthol ban and also helps fund the African American Tobacco Leadership Council.What followed has been well-documented in records made public from numerous lawsuits, that tobacco companies have targeted Black communities with menthol cigarettes for decades. They distributed free samples, offered discounts and sponsored countless concerts and special events, among them the famous Kool Jazz Festival. Tobacco companies also gained good will by advertising in newspapers and magazines geared to a Black readership — and by donating money to civil rights organizations.The companies have also been frequent donors to Black political candidates, and they have been generous supporters of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. Officials with Juul and Altria, which owns Philip Morris and also has a 35 percent stake in Juul, serve on the foundation’s corporate advisory board.The Biden administration still lacks a permanent F.D.A. commissioner, and Dr. Janet Woodcock, the acting commissioner, has not been vocal on tobacco issues. But public health advocates were heartened by the confirmation on Thursday of Xavier Becerra, the former attorney general of California, as the secretary of health and human services. In California, Mr. Becerra took aggressive action against tobacco and e-cigarette companies. In August, California became the second state — after Massachusetts’ lead — to ban the sale of all flavored tobacco products. (The law is on hold, pending an industry-sponsored referendum to repeal it, which will be on the ballot in November 2022.)The tobacco industry is in a tricky spot. For several years, the largest companies, Altria and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, now owned by British American Tobacco, have sought to position themselves as transforming their companies into responsible businesses being eager to to preventing young people from smoking and to developing less harmful products. For critics, the industry’s lobbying to protect its menthol brands contradicts that assertion.“It doesn’t seem very transformative if you’ve taken zero steps to address a particular product that has so disproportionately and detrimentally harmed Black Americans,” said Maura Healey, the attorney general of Massachusetts, which enacted a ban on flavors, including menthol, in June. “It’s time for the F.D.A. to act on the scientific evidence that is out there.”The number of Americans who smoke cigarettes has declined to 14 percent in 2019 from a peak of 40 percent in the mid-1960s, according to the F.D.A. That translates to an estimated 34.1 million adult smokers in the United States, nearly 20 million of whom smoke menthol cigarettes. Roughly 480,000 Americans die each year from tobacco-related illnesses and more than 16 million Americans live with a smoking-related disease. In 2009, Congress gave the F.D.A. the authority to regulate the tobacco industry. That year, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act banned all intentionally flavored cigarettes except menthol, which it referred to the F.D.A. for further study. The F.D.A. came close to a ban under the Obama administration but did not have sufficient White House support.In 2018, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the first F.D.A. commissioner of the Trump administration, announced the agency would ban menthol cigarettes. He was immediately opposed by Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, one of the few unapologetically pro-tobacco lawmakers left in Congress.Mr. Burr often promotes the jobs that the industry provides in his home state. His sons have two of those jobs: Tyler Burr works in state governmental affairs at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., and William Burr works in regulatory affairs at Altria, which owns Philip Morris.After the announcement, Mr. Burr started dispatching oversight letters to the F.D.A. every Friday from mid-November 2018 through early January 2019, with the exception of the week of Thanksgiving. Emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show the hundreds of minute questions from Mr. Burr that tied up staff for weeks. He also demanded personal travel records for the agency’s seven center directors and accused the F.D.A. of leaks.The F.D.A. did not back down, but Mr. Burr helped to persuade the Trump administration to kill the plan in early 2019, according to former White House officials. Mr. Burr’s office declined to comment. David Sutton, a spokesman for Altria, which makes Marlboro and other brands that come in menthol, defended keeping menthol cigarettes on the market.“Prohibition and criminalization of adult behavior does not work for products intended for adults 21-plus,” Mr. Sutton said.Kaelan Hollon, a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds, whose Newport brand is the biggest menthol seller in the United States, said a menthol ban would infringe on the rights of adults who preferred it to plain tobacco.But such arguments ignore the fact that most smokers start the habit and become addicted to nicotine when they are young, and are most likely to seek flavored products, according to the F.D.A.At this point, the F.D.A. could again propose a federal ban, which would then have to be approved by the White House. Alternatively, Congress could adopt legislation expanding the current restrictions on sales of flavored cigarettes to include menthol — effectively undoing the current exemption.More than 120 localities have already enacted bans of flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council is running an anti-menthol campaign with Delta Sigma Theta, a historically Black sorority, and others. The council is also a plaintiff, along with the Action on Smoking and Health, in the citizens’ petition that forced the April 29 deadline for the F.D.A. to say whether or not it will ban menthol.The Center for Black Health and Equity, a nonprofit organization in North Carolina, has also pushed hard on the issue, enlisting churches to sponsor “No Menthol Sundays.”In recent years, the tobacco industry has joined forces with certain civil rights activists, among them the Rev. Al Sharpton, who according to the California Department of Public Health, visited Black communities in the state, raising fear that a menthol ban would give the police an excuse to stop and frisk more Black individuals. Mr. Sharpton also helped to defeat a ban in New York.Ms. Bass has lost patience with that argument, saying a ban would prohibit selling menthol cigarettes, not possessing them.Ms. Bass said that a majority of lawmakers, including those in the Congressional Black Caucus, favor banning all tobacco flavors, including menthol. Eighty percent of the Congressional Black Caucus members voted last year for legislation that would have banned menthol cigarettes.Marc Scheineson, a lawyer with Alston and Bird, who represents small tobacco companies, believes that Representative James Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, may be the decisive vote. Mr. Clyburn was instrumental in developing support for Mr. Biden among Black Americans during his presidential campaign.“He can get whatever he wants,” Mr. Scheineson said. “I’m sure he’s got a wish list, but I’m sure all the African-American groups are coming to him and he’s got to prioritize.”Last year, Mr. Clyburn was absent for the House vote on legislation that would have banned menthol cigarettes. He has kept a low profile on the issue, not lobbying for tobacco companies but not standing in the way, either. Mr. Clyburn did not return requests seeking comment.Dr. Gottlieb believes the Biden administration will finally ban menthol cigarettes.“We opened the door on this in a Republican administration,” he said. “You don’t think a Democratic administration will finish the business? Of course they will.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "5  During a surge in attacks on Asian-Americans last spring, Andrew Yang — then recently off the 2020 presidential campaign trail — wrote an op-ed suggesting that “we Asian-Americans need to embrace and show our Americanness in ways we never have before.”To many Asian-Americans, the message seemed to place yet another burden on victims, and it stung.One year later, as Mr. Yang hopes to make history as New York City’s first Asian-American mayor, some New Yorkers have not forgotten that op-ed, or their sense that Mr. Yang’s remarks during the presidential campaign — describing himself as “an Asian man who likes math,” for instance — could feed stereotypical tropes.But many Asian-Americans also see in his candidacy an opportunity for representation at the highest level of city government, an increasingly meaningful metric amid violent attacks on Asian-Americans in New York and across the nation, including the fatal shootings in the Atlanta area last week that left eight people dead, six of them women of Asian descent.“I grew up Asian-American in New York, and I was always accustomed to a certain level of bullying, of racism, but it took a form of mockery, of invisibility, of disdain,” an emotional Mr. Yang said at a news conference in Times Square the next day. “That has metastasized into something far darker. You can feel it on the streets of New York.”As New York’s diverse Asian-American constituencies grapple with both overt violence — the city saw three more anti-Asian attacks on Sunday — and more subtle forms of bigotry, Mr. Yang and many of the other leading mayoral candidates are racing to show how they would lead a community in crisis. They are holding news conferences, contacting key leaders and attending rallies in solidarity with Asian-Americans who have at once demonstrated growing political power and are experiencing great pain now.But more than any other candidate, it is Mr. Yang who is in the spotlight, with the moment emerging as the most significant test yet of his ability to demonstrate leadership and empathy under pressure. He is also looking to respond in a way that will strengthen his support among Asian-Americans, a group whose backing he is counting on, while simultaneously building a broader coalition.In recent weeks, Mr. Yang has visited a branch of Xi’an Famous Foods, a popular New York restaurant chain that has been hit hard by anti-Asian harassment. Along with other contenders he joined a rally against Asian-American hate in Manhattan late last month and participated in a vigil on Friday and other outreach efforts over the weekend.“We have to start building bonds of connection with the Asian-American community to let them know that this city is theirs, this city is ours,” Mr. Yang said at a rally on Sunday. “One great way to do that is by electing the first Asian-American mayor in the history of New York City. Because you know I’ll take it seriously.”Throughout the race he has made frequent visits to heavily Asian-American neighborhoods across the city, expanding his coalition of “Yang Gang” supporters, a cohort that in his 2020 campaign included many young, white men. He has also taken multiple turns on national television to discuss attacks on Asian-Americans, including an appearance with his wife, Evelyn, on ABC’s “20/20” on Friday. Mr. Yang was not, however, the first contender to condemn the Georgia shootings, tweeting late that night instead about a St. Patrick’s Day scarf, in a move that struck some observers as tone deaf. (He later said that he had not seen the news on Tuesday. He issued a series of tweets about Atlanta on Wednesday morning, before making public remarks.)On Thursday, Mr. Yang’s voice appeared to waver with emotion as he spoke at an event convened by the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader. Speaking in starkly personal terms, Mr. Yang discussed the importance of “seeing that Asian-Americans are human beings, Asian-Americans are just as American as anyone else.”“I’m glad that he’s leaning in,” said Representative Grace Meng, the only Asian-American member of New York’s congressional delegation. “I felt like he was getting a little emotional. And I think that the Asian-American community likes to see more of that.”Jo-Ann Yoo, the executive director of New York’s Asian American Federation, said there were signs that Mr. Yang was connecting in particular with younger Asian-American voters.“They’ve said, well, nobody has invited us, drawn us into politics, we don’t see ourselves reflected in any of these spaces,” she said. “If those are the reasons Asian-American young people are not engaging, I think Yang’s done a pretty good job of leading the conversations and drawing young people in.”But, she added, “Other non-Asian candidates should not assume that Asians only vote for Asians.”Interviews with around a dozen community leaders, elected officials and voters suggest that the candidates who are best-known to Asian-American New Yorkers include Mr. Yang, a son of Taiwanese immigrants, and two veteran city officials: Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, and Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller.“It’s really a test of whether people are going to lean into longer-term relationships with electeds like Eric and Scott, or are they going to base their decision, especially the newer voters, on more identity politics, like with Andrew Yang?” said Ms. Meng, who has not endorsed a candidate.Some also mentioned interest in candidates including Maya D. Wiley, the former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio; Dianne Morales, who has relationships with community leaders from her time as a nonprofit executive; and Councilman Carlos Menchaca, a low-polling contender who represents a significant Asian-American population in Brooklyn. Ms. Meng also described Kathryn Garcia, a former city sanitation commissioner, as being especially proactive in her outreach.Like every other constituency in New York, the Asian-American slice of the electorate encompasses a diversity of views on high-priority issues including education, the economy, poverty and health care. But community leaders say that the matters of security and confronting bias have plainly become among the most urgent, though there are differences of opinion around the role policing should play in combating the uptick in attacks.“Especially during these times, it’s really important to be that candidate to show that you can empathize with the Asian-American community, that you’re reaching out actively to the community and you’re thinking of ways to bring different coalitions together,” Ms. Meng said.In Queens, the borough with the largest population of people of Asian descent, Mr. Yang’s greatest competition for those voters appears to be Mr. Adams, a former police officer who has been vocal in calling for more resources to combat anti-Asian attacks, and who is widely seen as a strong mayoral contender despite trailing Mr. Yang in the little public polling that is available.“Eric seems to have engaged in the broadest level of outreach in communities across the city, in particular, in Asian-American communities,” said State Senator John C. Liu of Queens, an influential voice in New York Asian-American politics.Asked about Mr. Yang’s outreach, he replied, “I’m going to limit my comments to things I will positively say about specific candidates.”“You can use that as my response to your specific question,” he added.The parents of Wenjian Liu, a police officer who was fatally shot in a patrol car in Brooklyn in 2014, endorsed Mr. Adams on Sunday.“Eric Adams was there for us when we lost our son — and he’s always been there for the Asian community, not just when he decided to run for mayor,” Wei Tang Liu and Xiu Yan Li said in a statement provided by the Adams campaign.It’s a message that some may see as a swipe at Mr. Yang, who has lived in New York City for years — building a career in the nonprofit and start-up worlds — but has not been active in local politics until now.At the rally against Asian-American hate late last month, Jessica Zhao, 36, said she felt torn about his candidacy. She approved of his outreach to Asian-American voters as a mayoral candidate, but she remained concerned by last spring’s op-ed, in which Mr. Yang offered a wide range of recommendations — including advising that Asian-Americans should wear red, white and blue.Indeed, Ms. Zhao had outfitted her husband — a Navy veteran — with masks bearing the military logo out of a “desperate” concern for his safety. But she detested the notion that proof of patriotism might ward off hate crimes, and was deeply bothered that, in her view, Mr. Yang seemed to put the onus for safety on Asian-Americans under attack.“To put even more of a burden on us — we could do even more to supposedly pacify racists enough that they won’t attack us? — really hit a nerve,” said Ms. Zhao, who is active with the Forest Hills Asian Association in Queens. “To say that he felt ashamed to be Asian, it was like the opposite of what we needed in that moment. We were so desperately hoping he could be a galvanizing voice for us.”In an interview last week, Mr. Yang declined to say whether he regretted writing the op-ed, but said repeatedly that he was “pained” by how it was perceived.“It pained me greatly that people felt I was somehow calling our Americanness into question when really my feeling was the opposite,” said Mr. Yang, who also pledged to be more active in New York’s Asian-American communities. “Which was, we are just as American as everyone else, and then, how can we help our people in this time when there is so much need and deprivation?”Asked whether he had changed how he approached matters of race and identity since running for president, he paused.“This is a very difficult time,” Mr. Yang finally said. “Our sense of who we are in this country has changed appreciably in the last number of months.”And in the last few weeks, Ms. Zhao’s sense of Mr. Yang has changed, too, she said.“Seeing his, I guess, evolution, in being able to properly address anti-Asian sentiment in this country, that has been encouraging,” she said. “I can tell that he brings a unique perspective of what Asians are suffering through. And that’s when representation really does come through. That’s when it does matter.”Jeffery C.

       "6  WASHINGTON — The United States placed sanctions on top Chinese officials on Monday, as part of a multinational effort to punish Beijing for human rights abuses against the largely Muslim Uyghur minority group, which American officials have called a genocide.The penalties — in coordination with the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada — come days after the Biden administration’s heated encounter with Chinese officials in Alaska, and will most likely widen tensions between Washington and Beijing.“Amid growing international condemnation, the P.R.C. continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity” in its western Xinjiang region, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in a statement on Monday, referring to the People’s Republic of China.“The United States reiterates its calls on the P.R.C. to bring an end to the repression of Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, including by releasing all those arbitrarily held in internment camps and detention facilities,” he added.The United States imposed penalties on Wang Junzheng, the secretary of the Party Committee of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and Chen Mingguo, director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau, for their roles in detaining and severely abusing Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, the Treasury Department said.The sanctions were imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, which allows the executive branch to use economic penalties to punish officials of other nations for human rights violations. The action will freeze any assets these officials hold in the United States.The U.S. move came hours after the European Union, United Kingdom and Canada levied their own sanctions against Chinese officials and entities for human rights violations in Xinjiang. The European Union targeted four Chinese officials, along with the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau. The United Kingdom and Canada did the same.In response to the European Union action on Monday, Chinese officials imposed sanctions on 10 Europeans, including members of the European Parliament.“This move, based on nothing but lies and disinformation, disregards and distorts facts,” a representative of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement condemning the European Union action, adding that the effort “grossly interferes in China’s internal affairs” and “severely undermines China-E.U. relations.”Mr. Blinken said the joint action is an effort on the part of the United States to work “multilaterally to advance respect for human rights.” A joint statement released by the top diplomats representing the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, among others, demanded that Beijing “end its repressive practices against Uyghur Muslims and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, and to release those arbitrarily detained.”Two Western allies heavily dependent on trade with China — Australia and New Zealand — issued their own joint statement endorsing the Xinjiang-related sanctions, but stopped short of announcing their own penalties on Chinese officials.China’s crackdown on Uyghurs has included forced sterilizations and sending hundreds of thousands of people — if not a million or more — to indoctrination camps intended to instill loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party and break down adherence to Islam.In a separate action on Monday, the United States announced sanctions in coordination with the European Union that named military officials and other entities in Myanmar for their violent repression of democratic protests.The U.S. action against Beijing seems in line with the diplomatic vision set forth by Mr. Blinken and Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, in their first face-to-face meeting with Chinese officials in Alaska last week. Mr. Sullivan said the United States remained “cleareyed” about the challenges that lay ahead for the world's two largest economic and technological powers.The penalties also come on the heels of the Biden administration’s decision to place sanctions on 24 Chinese officials for undermining democratic freedoms in Hong Kong, and are in a similar vein to the Trump administration’s strategy of using sanctions as a means to punish Chinese officials for human rights abuses.Omer Kanat, the executive director of the Uyghur Human Rights Project, praised the coordinated effort by many nations to

       "7  Good morning. We’re covering the deepening global vaccine divide and a multination effort to punish China for its treatment of Uyghur Muslims.Of the Covid-19 vaccine doses given globally, roughly three-quarters have gone to only 10 countries. At least 30 countries have not yet injected a single person.Many poorer nations could wait years for their shots, a delay that scientists warn could haunt all countries if the continued spread of the coronavirus allows it to mutate in ways that undermine vaccines. Many countries were relying on the global vaccine program known as Covax, which was created around the idea that all would buy vaccines through a single mechanism, but dozens of wealthy nations went straight to pharmaceutical companies and elbowed the program out of the way.The toll: Already, unvaccinated doctors and nurses have died this year in countries including Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, depleting health systems that can ill afford to lose any more workers.Case study: Even in Kenya, one of Africa’s wealthier nations, the first vaccine shipment arrived only this month, later than anticipated and with only a quarter of the doses promised. No one knows when the next batch will arrive. In the best-case scenario, Kenya is expecting to vaccinate only 30 percent of its people, or about 16 million out of almost 50 million, by the middle of 2023.Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.In other developments:Britain, Canada, the U.S. and the European Union imposed penalties on Chinese officials on Monday over human rights abuses of Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The moves come days after a heated encounter in Alaska between U.S. and Chinese senior officials, and is likely to increase tensions between the nations and Beijing. Australia is debating a motion that would call for a U.N. inquiry and for its government to ensure that the country does not profit from forced labor in Xinjiang.The U.S. froze the assets of two Xinjiang officials and called for the release of those held in forced labor camps in the region. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China’s leadership “continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang.”The E.U. targeted four officials in Xinjiang, imposing its first significant sanctions on China in more than three decades.Backlash: Beijing retaliated immediately, blacklisting 10 European officials who work on the bloc’s policy toward China. The Chinese government denies allegations of abuse and claims the camps are needed to fight extremism.On the ground: Exiled Uyghur families described being separated from their children, some as young as 5 years old, who are forced to stay in state orphanages, according to a recent Amnesty International report.Israelis are voting on Tuesday in their fourth election in just two years. Many of them feel numbed by their endless election cycle — a mood that contrasts with the Palestinians, who are excited about a rare chance to vote, in elections in May.The Israeli vote is the embodiment of political paralysis caused in part by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s efforts to remain in office while on trial for corruption. Mr. Netanyahu hopes the country’s successful Covid-19 vaccination campaign will help him win. But polls suggest that the outcome is unlikely to break the deadlock. Many Israelis are bracing for a fifth election later this year.The Palestinian vote, set for May 22, will be the first since a violent rift in 2007 between Hamas, the faction that controls the Gaza Strip, and its rival, Fatah. More than 93 percent of Palestinians have registered to vote, illustrating an initial enthusiasm for the process. Young people want a clearer path to statehood and a more competent government.Geopolitics: Mr. Netanyahu’s plans to visit the United Arab Emirates and his bombast about Emirati investments have turned into a diplomatic debacle. Emirati officials sent clear signals that the Persian Gulf country would not be drawn into Mr. Netanyahu’s re-election campaign.A Morning ReadModel trains are the latest industry getting a pandemic-spurred boost from people seeking new hobbies. With sales rising, Märklin, a 162-year-old German company, is hiring new apprentices to learn the precise art of making miniature trains. (Take a virtual tour of the factory here.)“Outside, there is total chaos,” one enthusiast said. “But inside, around my little train set, it is quiet, it is picturesque.”Covid has traumatized the U.S. Dr. Diane Meier, the director of the Center to Advance Palliative Care in New York, discussed what is needed to heal with our Talk columnist. Here’s an excerpt.Has the pandemic affected our collective attitude toward grief?There are many shadow pandemics. One is the trauma to the entire health profession during this last year. The other trauma is the roughly 10 people for every person who has died from Covid who are grieving. That’s over five million people. That is a shadow pandemic that will be with us long after we get the virus under control. Our current president has worked hard to begin to address that through the ritual ceremonies to remember the dead and honor them, and he has talked a lot about his own losses, to normalize talking about losses and how they’re with you every day. That’s important. We need other people to do it, too.Can you tease out the link you suggested earlier between trauma and killing the other?The analogy is post-traumatic stress disorder: an overreaction to new traumas because the prior traumas were never addressed, never expressed, never worked through. So everything that happens re-triggers it. There’s a book called “The Body Keeps the Score,” and that’s what it’s about: Things that happened to you years ago don’t ever go away. They are embedded in your mind and body and inform how you react to things that happen today.What to CookThis spinach soup with tahini and lemon is bright and complex.What to WatchIf you like the farce and brotherly conflicts of “Frasier,” you might like the funny, lovely British comedy “Back,” which crams more jokes and details into its episodes than some shows manage in a season.Where to Go (Virtually)Nintendo’s theme park opened in Japan last week.

       "      <td>[This week marks a year since everything began shutting down because of the pandemic, including concert venues across the country. We’ve made it four full seasons without dancing to blaring music, without swaying alongside a spellbound crowd, without exaggeratedly mouthing beer orders to friends headed for concessions. To those with postponed concert tickets still wasting away in their email inboxes, might you settle for … watching the Grammy Awards this Sunday night?Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightYes, it’s an unfair comparison. But the Recording Academy and CBS have committed to celebrating what they bill as “Music’s Biggest Night” and, as awards telecasts continue to struggle with ratings, will be relying on star power to attract potential viewers. Taylor Swift, BTS and Dua Lipa are headlining the ceremony, joined by Cardi B, Bad Bunny, Harry Styles and many others.Here’s a closer look at what to expect from the show:Who’s nominated?Beyoncé leads the pack with nine nods, which puts her at 79 career nominations — the most of any female artist. Swift, Lipa and Roddy Ricch follow with six nominations each, and both women are up for album of the year. That category features an eclectic mix of artists — joining Swift and Lipa are Jhené Aiko, Black Pumas, Coldplay, Jacob Collier, Haim and Post Malone. Megan Thee Stallion, DaBaby and Billie Eilish, who swept the main categories last year, landed four nods each.ADADGrammy snubs were especially glaring this year: the Weeknd, a three-time winner whose album “After Hours” held the Billboard 200′s top slot for four consecutive weeks, seemed to make as many headlines as the nominees. The singer accused the Grammys of being “corrupt” after noting his absence from the nominees announced in November. Variety and Rolling Stone reported that the exclusion might have been related to his headlining the Super Bowl halftime show.“Anonymous expert committees” review nomination choices presented by the Recording Academy’s thousands of voting members and choose which artists make the final cut, according to the New York Times. In a Times article published Thursday, the Weeknd announced he would be boycotting the Grammys going forward because of this: “Because of the secret committees,” he wrote in a statement, “I will no longer allow my label to submit my music to the Grammys.”You’ll never guess who leads this year’s Grammy noms! (Just kidding, it’s Beyoncé and Taylor Swift.)Pop singer Halsey gave the Weeknd a shout-out in her own posts about being snubbed, writing on Instagram that the Grammy nominations are “not always about the music or quality or culture.”ADAD“The Grammys are an elusive process,” she wrote. “It can often be about behind the scenes private performances, knowing the right people, campaigning through the grapevine, with the right handshake and ‘bribes’ that can be just ambiguous enough to pass as ‘not bribes.’ ”Halsey’s call for “more transparency or reform” echoes others drawing attention to inequities highlighted by the nominations each year. The University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative released a report this month analyzing gender within the music industry and found that women have made up just 13.4 percent of all Grammy nominees from the 2013 ceremony onward. That percentage drops to the single digits when zeroing in on major categories such as album, record or producer of the year.The percentage of women nominated each year has increased over time, albeit gradually. This year, roughly 28 percent of the nominees are women.Who’s performing?The Grammys can most concisely be described as back-to-back performances with awards sprinkled throughout. Many of the artists performing have also been nominated.ADADHere is the full, alphabetized lineup: Bad Bunny, Black Pumas, Cardi B, BTS, Brandi Carlile, DaBaby, Doja Cat, Eilish, Mickey Guyton, Haim, Brittany Howard, Miranda Lambert, Lil Baby, Lipa, Malone, Chris Martin, John Mayer, Megan Thee Stallion, Maren Morris, Ricch, Styles and Swift.Rolling Stone reported that the Grammys will be “a multi-stage, audience-free show that highlights the year’s creative triumphs, social justice movements, as well as Covid-19′s impact on the arts.” The ceremony is set to last 3½ hours and will take place at an “undisclosed building in Los Angeles” instead of its usual home at the Staples Center. Featured artists will perform their sets on four stages, according to Rolling Stone, and one will be set aside for presenters.Who’s presenting?The Recording Academy announced it would honor independent venues affected financially by the pandemic by enlisting employees from New York’s Apollo Theater, Nashville’s Station Inn as well as the Troubadour and the Hotel Cafe in Los Angeles to present “various categories” throughout the night.They’re presenting all 83 categories?Goodness, no. Hours before the main show, the Recording Academy will hold the Grammy Awards Premiere Ceremony, which has its own host, Jhené Aiko, and also features performances from nominees like Burna Boy, Lido Pimienta, Poppy and Rufus Wainwright. Roughly 70 categories will be announced during this pre-show, streamed on the Grammys website Sunday at 3 p.m.Who’s hosting the main ceremony?Trevor Noah, nominated last year for best comedy album, will be emceeing. The “Daily Show” host joked in the November announcement that “as a one-time GRAMMY nominee, I am the best person to provide a shoulder to all the amazing artists who do not win on the night because I too know the pain of not winning the award! (This is a metaphorical shoulder, I’m not trying to catch Corona).”ADADIn a recent interview with Billboard, the comedian said he was drawn to the multistage setup, likening it “to the feel of a music festival but designed for an audience at home.”Why is this happening now?Originally scheduled for Jan. 31, the Grammys were postponed to March “after thoughtful conversations with health experts, our host and artists scheduled to appear,” according to a January statement from interim Recording Academy chief Harvey Mason Jr., CBS’s Jack Sussman and executive producer Ben Winston. The coronavirus had been surging in Los Angeles at the time, to the point where hospitals were turning ambulances away over oxygen shortages.How can I watch the telecast?The 63rd Grammy Awards will air on CBS and stream on Paramount Plus (formerly known as CBS All Access) at 8 p.m. Sunday.]</td>\n",

Subscribe today.arrow-rightSunday’s Grammy Awards hit a record low of 8.8 million viewers — down 53 percent from last year’s 18.7 million viewers — according to Nielsen ratings, which tracks television viewing habits.The ceremony’s poor viewership ran counter to the general positive reaction from those who tuned in to the scaled-down affair. Washington Post pop music critic Chris Richards called it “the most coherent, purposeful, hospitable, gratifying Grammy night of the past 20 years, far and away.”Megan Thee Stallion, Taylor Swift win big on a Grammy night that felt tastefully smallThere was a conscious effort to try to mitigate some of the pitfalls other award ceremonies encountered during the pandemic era. Last month’s Golden Globes were hampered by technical issues that made the Zoom setup feel more like an awkward business meeting than a celebrity confab, while conversely, a lack of gaffes made September’s remote Emmys a comparably dull affair.ADADAs host Trevor Noah told Reuters before the ceremony, Grammy producers “figured out how to make an awards show for the time as opposed to trying to crowbar an awards show into it.” The comedian emceed the night’s televised proceedings from a stage outside Los Angeles’s Staples Center, the ceremony’s usual venue. Nominees and artists who were performing on an auxiliary soundstage nearby rotated in and out of the pared-down live audience (with the exception of South Korean boy band BTS, who performed from Seoul), so there was no chance of connectivity glitches.Beyoncé broke the record for most Grammys wins for a singer with 28, while Taylor Swift became the first female artist to win album of the year three times. (Erin Patrick  O'Connor/The Washington Post)Disappointed networks may lean on the fact that pandemic-era ratings for live events are down across the entertainment spectrum. The Golden Globes saw a 64 percent drop in viewers, setting an all-time low with 6.9 million; for comparison, the new CBS hour-long drama “The Equalizer” caught more eyes (7.5 million viewers) in the same 8 p.m. time slot. Even this year’s Super Bowl, typically a surefire viewership bonanza, saw ratings nosedive to a number not seen since 1969.Some experts are not convinced that there’s an ongoing sea change in viewership habits, and low ratings can be chalked up to an aberration of scattershot viewing over the last year at home. But there are some relevant considerations that could shed some light on the diminishing returns for award shows.While television ratings are the still the biggest game around in terms of generating advertising dollars — and the Grammys ceremony was Sunday night’s highest-rated broadcast regardless of overall decline — many media companies are pouring resources into streaming platforms in the all-out effort to keep the divided attention of cord-cutters. That strategy appeared to pay off: Variety reports that “it was the most-streamed Grammy show ever with 83% more live streams compared to 2020,” and was still a top trending topic on social media platforms.ADADBut it’s not just ratings and viewership that plague these major award shows. Myriad diversity and inclusion controversies continue to arise, calling into question the validity and outsize importance of such honors in the first place.The Recording Academy, the body which hosts and awards the Grammys, is still sorting through an interim leadership crisis after allegations of vote-rigging and sexual misconduct toppled the previous regime. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which awards the Golden Globes, was revealed in a recent Los Angeles Times investigation to have no Black members in its cohort; it was also reported that the HFPA accepted lavish gifts from studios in return for further nomination consideration.Even institutional reforms don’t necessarily lead to tidy answers. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science’s changed the makeup of its voting body following efforts including the 2015 #OscarsSoWhite campaign, but the major Oscar categories for acting, directing and writing continue to underrepresent different ethnic, gender and racial identities.The Oscars’ long history of getting called out for lack of diversityMonday’s Academy Award nominations were reflective of some of those issues, which are likely on the mind of those at ABC, who will broadcast the ceremony live from two separate venues on April 25. The poor ratings performance of recent live events is surely an unwelcome omen for the network, as the Oscars are typically the highest-rated of the major award shows. But even before the pandemic provided ratings cover, the February 2020 ceremony lost 6 million viewers from 2019.]</td>\n",

As a self-admitted stereotypical, White, middle-aged woman from Georgia, Murdock was highly skeptical of the genre, especially since the only foreign music she listened to was opera. But she agreed to accompany her daughter to a BTS show.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right“I knew I would be bored out of my skull, but my daughter is the most important thing in my life, and I was willing to sacrifice my concept of a great concert for her,” said Murdock, 54, who was surprised to find an audience in which she was not the oldest attendee. “Did they solve all my problems? Lord no. Did they change my life? Well, sort of. I am not the same person today because I opened my mind of what was acceptable and good.”ADLike many mothers around the nation, Murdock started listening to BTS because of her daughter. They joined the typical teen-fan set, along with a varied batch of admirers of all ages and backgrounds, including professional wrestler John Cena and Indian composer A.R. Rahman.ADThe group’s fandom, called ARMY (Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth), is why seven 20-somethings from South Korea singing mostly in Korean can repeatedly sell out shows, top charts and break records, changing the face, business and culture of pop music around the world. Together, the fandom is family, supporting each other through the Black Lives Matter movement and global crises such as the pandemic.BTS’s “success has signaled a global breakthrough for artists around the globe,” said Rahman, the man behind many Bollywood and Hollywood hits. “It reminds me of the time we experienced here in India a decade ago when ‘Jai Ho’ from ‘Slumdog Millionaire’ won the Grammy and the Oscar — culturally, there was a sense of ‘having arrived.’ ”ADBesides last year becoming the first group since the Beatles to earn three No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 chart in less than 12 months, BTS’s latest single “Dynamite” recently spent 12 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Artist 100 chart. That song’s music video broke the YouTube record for most views in a day with more than 100 million. The group’s online concert in October also drew more than 100 million likes. Up next is BTS’s ninth album, “Be,” out Friday.K-pop band BTS roared to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts in the United States on Aug. 30, becoming the first Korean pop act to debut at No. 1. (Reuters)“ARMY had both incredible online impact and even financial power, shown in records and websites we’d broken, items we’d sold out and album sales,” said Erika Overton, 40, who convinced her 65-year-old mom to become a fan and helped found One in an ARMY, a charitable organization that rallied the ARMY to match BTS’s $1 million donation to Black Lives Matter. “I discovered their desire, like mine, to help these boys achieve success … the camaraderie and sense of family and friendship across all boundaries … and the incredible focus of power that happened when everyone focused on the same goal.”ADMobilized over social media, these fans are the ultimate hype crew for BTS, propelling the group to become a global brand, selling everything from its own line of Barbies to an SUV. And unlike many artists, BTS members own a stake in their label, Big Hit Entertainment, which went public in October with South Korea’s biggest stock offering in three years.The branding genius of K-pop band BTSLike other boy bands, BTS has the looks, the pipes and the style, but it was the group’s message that changed Murdock’s mind.AD“They seemed ‘real,’ discussed challenges, very unlike the rock bands of my past, where the lyrics were about getting drunk, fighting, playing hard,” said Murdock, who has since gone to two more of the group’s concerts with her daughter. “I did not know I was looking for it or even needed it, but it was refreshing. I have been depressed, I have suffered loss.”ADMurdock’s daughter Chelsea first found BTS while studying for graduate school exams. The band’s songs became her hype music and solace after her grandmother died.“Something about the intonation and the sort of desperation in [BTS member Suga’s] tone [in ‘First Love’], it just struck a chord with me,” said Chelsea, 31, who wrote about the song in a fan academic journal and is teaching a class incorporating BTS at Clemson University. “Without understanding the language, I still understood.”The name of the group also reflects the members’ character. BTS, which stands for Beyond the Scene, started off as an acronym for “Bangtan Sonyeondan,” which translates to “Bulletproof Boy Scouts,” and means to “block out stereotypes, criticisms and expectations,” explained member J-Hope in an interview on Korean radio when the band first debuted in 2013.ADADAnd while fans also applaud the band’s attitude, starting off as underdog at a smaller label, BTS did have the benefit of the label founder’s experience, explained Tamar Herman, who has been covering the group for Billboard Magazine since 2016. Big Hit Entertainment co-chief executive Bang Si-hyuk, known as “Hitman” Bang, was a composer for one of the biggest labels, JYP Entertainment. He worked with such artists as Rain, the first Korean to win an MTV award, and Wonder Girls, the first Korean group to enter the Billboard 100 chart.Initially, Big Hit’s other artists “didn’t have much luck,” Herman said, after its girl group Glam disbanded and members of its boy band 2AM left.“BTS was really their last shot and they kind of gave it their all,” said Herman, who recently released a book about BTS. “And because they were giving them their all, they were able to try some new things.”ADADSo instead of primarily appearing on South Korean television, like other K-pop groups, BTS tried out social media, chatting with fans on Twitter.BTS’s songs were not typical pop either. While the group started in hip-hop, their music encompassed different genres, Herman said, and incorporated a vision for the world to be a better place.“We started to hear remarkable stories from our fans all over the world, how our message helped them overcome their hardships in life and start loving themselves,” said BTS leader RM at the U.N. General Assembly in 2018, where they were campaigning for UNICEF to end violence against children. “These stories constantly remind us of our responsibility.”ADAnd fans of the group fully believe in the boy band’s message of hope. The ARMY has a saying: “You will find BTS when you need them the most.”AD“I was able to find comfort through their music during my dark days,” said Danielle Given Acido, a 20-year-old college student in the Philippines studying petroleum engineering. “They speak the words I cannot speak on my own. Compared to mainstream K-pop, their music conveys the reality of the pain of the youth and the struggles.”To better help each other, fans created an ARMY Help Center in 2018, a network of 150 trained volunteers across 40 countries willing to be a “shoulder to lean on, especially those who are from countries and cultures that still consider mental illness to be taboo,” said Asmae El Mansari, a 27-year-old administrator from Morocco. She estimates that the network has been able to help at least 30,000 people in the past few years.ADDuring the pandemic, ARMY has also been a lifesaver for fans.“Somehow there is an unwritten oath between us, ‘through thick and thin, we will go through things together,’ ” said Acido, who is also an administrator for BTS International, a fan community with nearly 260,000 followers on Twitter.This extended network helped another mother find joy during the pandemic. Candace Epps-Robertson, 42, also discovered BTS through her daughter, 14-year-old Phoenix. Epps-Robertson’s ARMY friends “kicked in support” with constant group chats and texts, which convinced the assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to devote a class to the “rhetoric of resistance” — how communities such as BTS and its ARMY affected Black Lives Matter. She’s also used the group’s lyrics to talk through issues with her daughter about dating and race.ADAD“When BTS spoke on BLM, it made me feel like they are recognizing me, and my community, and telling me that I matter to them,” said Phoenix, who is learning Korean to better understand songs. “I think we are connected by our desire to do good in a way that reflects this message.”K-pop's recognition of Black Lives MatterBecause fans feel like BTS has their back, they show the same support for the group. When an Australian pop culture show made fun of the group, the ARMY created a social campaign, prompting an apology.“It’s a little bit like a couple that has formed a love relationship,” said Murray Stein, a psychoanalyst, whose book, “Jung’s Map of the Soul” was the premise for BTS’s seventh album. “You say anything bad about the one I love? I’m going to have to go on the defensive.”Psychoanalytic principles are not usually in pop, Stein said, so he’s intrigued about the meaning behind BTS’s newest album, “Be.”AD“It’s almost a Buddhist state, just pure being,” Stein said. “Don’t worry about who you are, what you are, what you’re going to do next. Are you going to be successful or not? Just being. So maybe they’re moving in that direction.”As for the group’s immediate future, BTS’s biggest challenge may be the actual army. Ranging from 23 to 27, the members of BTS are subject to South Korean law, which says they must enlist for compulsory military service before turning 28. This could put their careers on hold for around two years.But fans are not worried.“I believe they have staying power,” Chelsea Murdock said. “I know that I’ll be there as long as they’re there, and even if they’re not active, I’m still going to be listening to their music.”Read more:The BTS effect: Making peace with my teenager through K-popChina went up against a K-pop giant — and lostKorean pop culture is everywhere.

       "0  [This week marks a year since everything began shutting down because of the pandemic, including concert venues across the country. We’ve made it four full seasons without dancing to blaring music, without swaying alongside a spellbound crowd, without exaggeratedly mouthing beer orders to friends headed for concessions. To those with postponed concert tickets still wasting away in their email inboxes, might you settle for … watching the Grammy Awards this Sunday night?Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-rightYes, it’s an unfair comparison. But the Recording Academy and CBS have committed to celebrating what they bill as “Music’s Biggest Night” and, as awards telecasts continue to struggle with ratings, will be relying on star power to attract potential viewers. Taylor Swift, BTS and Dua Lipa are headlining the ceremony, joined by Cardi B, Bad Bunny, Harry Styles and many others.Here’s a closer look at what to expect from the show:Who’s nominated?Beyoncé leads the pack with nine nods, which puts her at 79 career nominations — the most of any female artist. Swift, Lipa and Roddy Ricch follow with six nominations each, and both women are up for album of the year. That category features an eclectic mix of artists — joining Swift and Lipa are Jhené Aiko, Black Pumas, Coldplay, Jacob Collier, Haim and Post Malone. Megan Thee Stallion, DaBaby and Billie Eilish, who swept the main categories last year, landed four nods each.ADADGrammy snubs were especially glaring this year: the Weeknd, a three-time winner whose album “After Hours” held the Billboard 200′s top slot for four consecutive weeks, seemed to make as many headlines as the nominees. The singer accused the Grammys of being “corrupt” after noting his absence from the nominees announced in November. Variety and Rolling Stone reported that the exclusion might have been related to his headlining the Super Bowl halftime show.“Anonymous expert committees” review nomination choices presented by the Recording Academy’s thousands of voting members and choose which artists make the final cut, according to the New York Times. In a Times article published Thursday, the Weeknd announced he would be boycotting the Grammys going forward because of this: “Because of the secret committees,” he wrote in a statement, “I will no longer allow my label to submit my music to the Grammys.”You’ll never guess who leads this year’s Grammy noms! (Just kidding, it’s Beyoncé and Taylor Swift.)Pop singer Halsey gave the Weeknd a shout-out in her own posts about being snubbed, writing on Instagram that the Grammy nominations are “not always about the music or quality or culture.”ADAD“The Grammys are an elusive process,” she wrote. “It can often be about behind the scenes private performances, knowing the right people, campaigning through the grapevine, with the right handshake and ‘bribes’ that can be just ambiguous enough to pass as ‘not bribes.’ ”Halsey’s call for “more transparency or reform” echoes others drawing attention to inequities highlighted by the nominations each year. The University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative released a report this month analyzing gender within the music industry and found that women have made up just 13.4 percent of all Grammy nominees from the 2013 ceremony onward. That percentage drops to the single digits when zeroing in on major categories such as album, record or producer of the year.The percentage of women nominated each year has increased over time, albeit gradually. This year, roughly 28 percent of the nominees are women.Who’s performing?The Grammys can most concisely be described as back-to-back performances with awards sprinkled throughout. Many of the artists performing have also been nominated.ADADHere is the full, alphabetized lineup: Bad Bunny, Black Pumas, Cardi B, BTS, Brandi Carlile, DaBaby, Doja Cat, Eilish, Mickey Guyton, Haim, Brittany Howard, Miranda Lambert, Lil Baby, Lipa, Malone, Chris Martin, John Mayer, Megan Thee Stallion, Maren Morris, Ricch, Styles and Swift.Rolling Stone reported that the Grammys will be “a multi-stage, audience-free show that highlights the year’s creative triumphs, social justice movements, as well as Covid-19′s impact on the arts.” The ceremony is set to last 3½ hours and will take place at an “undisclosed building in Los Angeles” instead of its usual home at the Staples Center. Featured artists will perform their sets on four stages, according to Rolling Stone, and one will be set aside for presenters.Who’s presenting?The Recording Academy announced it would honor independent venues affected financially by the pandemic by enlisting employees from New York’s Apollo Theater, Nashville’s Station Inn as well as the Troubadour and the Hotel Cafe in Los Angeles to present “various categories” throughout the night.They’re presenting all 83 categories?Goodness, no. Hours before the main show, the Recording Academy will hold the Grammy Awards Premiere Ceremony, which has its own host, Jhené Aiko, and also features performances from nominees like Burna Boy, Lido Pimienta, Poppy and Rufus Wainwright. Roughly 70 categories will be announced during this pre-show, streamed on the Grammys website Sunday at 3 p.m.Who’s hosting the main ceremony?Trevor Noah, nominated last year for best comedy album, will be emceeing. The “Daily Show” host joked in the November announcement that “as a one-time GRAMMY nominee, I am the best person to provide a shoulder to all the amazing artists who do not win on the night because I too know the pain of not winning the award! (This is a metaphorical shoulder, I’m not trying to catch Corona).”ADADIn a recent interview with Billboard, the comedian said he was drawn to the multistage setup, likening it “to the feel of a music festival but designed for an audience at home.”Why is this happening now?Originally scheduled for Jan. 31, the Grammys were postponed to March “after thoughtful conversations with health experts, our host and artists scheduled to appear,” according to a January statement from interim Recording Academy chief Harvey Mason Jr., CBS’s Jack Sussman and executive producer Ben Winston. The coronavirus had been surging in Los Angeles at the time, to the point where hospitals were turning ambulances away over oxygen shortages.How can I watch the telecast?The 63rd Grammy Awards will air on CBS and stream on Paramount Plus (formerly known as CBS All Access) at 8 p.m. Sunday.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Subscribe today.arrow-rightSunday’s Grammy Awards hit a record low of 8.8 million viewers — down 53 percent from last year’s 18.7 million viewers — according to Nielsen ratings, which tracks television viewing habits.The ceremony’s poor viewership ran counter to the general positive reaction from those who tuned in to the scaled-down affair. Washington Post pop music critic Chris Richards called it “the most coherent, purposeful, hospitable, gratifying Grammy night of the past 20 years, far and away.”Megan Thee Stallion, Taylor Swift win big on a Grammy night that felt tastefully smallThere was a conscious effort to try to mitigate some of the pitfalls other award ceremonies encountered during the pandemic era. Last month’s Golden Globes were hampered by technical issues that made the Zoom setup feel more like an awkward business meeting than a celebrity confab, while conversely, a lack of gaffes made September’s remote Emmys a comparably dull affair.ADADAs host Trevor Noah told Reuters before the ceremony, Grammy producers “figured out how to make an awards show for the time as opposed to trying to crowbar an awards show into it.” The comedian emceed the night’s televised proceedings from a stage outside Los Angeles’s Staples Center, the ceremony’s usual venue. Nominees and artists who were performing on an auxiliary soundstage nearby rotated in and out of the pared-down live audience (with the exception of South Korean boy band BTS, who performed from Seoul), so there was no chance of connectivity glitches.Beyoncé broke the record for most Grammys wins for a singer with 28, while Taylor Swift became the first female artist to win album of the year three times. (Erin Patrick  O'Connor/The Washington Post)Disappointed networks may lean on the fact that pandemic-era ratings for live events are down across the entertainment spectrum. The Golden Globes saw a 64 percent drop in viewers, setting an all-time low with 6.9 million; for comparison, the new CBS hour-long drama “The Equalizer” caught more eyes (7.5 million viewers) in the same 8 p.m. time slot. Even this year’s Super Bowl, typically a surefire viewership bonanza, saw ratings nosedive to a number not seen since 1969.Some experts are not convinced that there’s an ongoing sea change in viewership habits, and low ratings can be chalked up to an aberration of scattershot viewing over the last year at home. But there are some relevant considerations that could shed some light on the diminishing returns for award shows.While television ratings are the still the biggest game around in terms of generating advertising dollars — and the Grammys ceremony was Sunday night’s highest-rated broadcast regardless of overall decline — many media companies are pouring resources into streaming platforms in the all-out effort to keep the divided attention of cord-cutters. That strategy appeared to pay off: Variety reports that “it was the most-streamed Grammy show ever with 83% more live streams compared to 2020,” and was still a top trending topic on social media platforms.ADADBut it’s not just ratings and viewership that plague these major award shows. Myriad diversity and inclusion controversies continue to arise, calling into question the validity and outsize importance of such honors in the first place.The Recording Academy, the body which hosts and awards the Grammys, is still sorting through an interim leadership crisis after allegations of vote-rigging and sexual misconduct toppled the previous regime. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which awards the Golden Globes, was revealed in a recent Los Angeles Times investigation to have no Black members in its cohort; it was also reported that the HFPA accepted lavish gifts from studios in return for further nomination consideration.Even institutional reforms don’t necessarily lead to tidy answers. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science’s changed the makeup of its voting body following efforts including the 2015 #OscarsSoWhite campaign, but the major Oscar categories for acting, directing and writing continue to underrepresent different ethnic, gender and racial identities.The Oscars’ long history of getting called out for lack of diversityMonday’s Academy Award nominations were reflective of some of those issues, which are likely on the mind of those at ABC, who will broadcast the ceremony live from two separate venues on April 25. The poor ratings performance of recent live events is surely an unwelcome omen for the network, as the Oscars are typically the highest-rated of the major award shows. But even before the pandemic provided ratings cover, the February 2020 ceremony lost 6 million viewers from 2019.]

       "2  [As a Def Leppard fan, Beth Murdock didn’t expect to like Korean pop.Hair bands were more her jam. As a self-admitted stereotypical, White, middle-aged woman from Georgia, Murdock was highly skeptical of the genre, especially since the only foreign music she listened to was opera. But she agreed to accompany her daughter to a BTS show.Support our journalism. Subscribe today.arrow-right“I knew I would be bored out of my skull, but my daughter is the most important thing in my life, and I was willing to sacrifice my concept of a great concert for her,” said Murdock, 54, who was surprised to find an audience in which she was not the oldest attendee. “Did they solve all my problems? Lord no. Did they change my life? Well, sort of. I am not the same person today because I opened my mind of what was acceptable and good.”ADLike many mothers around the nation, Murdock started listening to BTS because of her daughter. They joined the typical teen-fan set, along with a varied batch of admirers of all ages and backgrounds, including professional wrestler John Cena and Indian composer A.R. Rahman.ADThe group’s fandom, called ARMY (Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth), is why seven 20-somethings from South Korea singing mostly in Korean can repeatedly sell out shows, top charts and break records, changing the face, business and culture of pop music around the world. Together, the fandom is family, supporting each other through the Black Lives Matter movement and global crises such as the pandemic.BTS’s “success has signaled a global breakthrough for artists around the globe,” said Rahman, the man behind many Bollywood and Hollywood hits. “It reminds me of the time we experienced here in India a decade ago when ‘Jai Ho’ from ‘Slumdog Millionaire’ won the Grammy and the Oscar — culturally, there was a sense of ‘having arrived.’ ”ADBesides last year becoming the first group since the Beatles to earn three No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 chart in less than 12 months, BTS’s latest single “Dynamite” recently spent 12 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Artist 100 chart. That song’s music video broke the YouTube record for most views in a day with more than 100 million. The group’s online concert in October also drew more than 100 million likes. Up next is BTS’s ninth album, “Be,” out Friday.K-pop band BTS roared to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts in the United States on Aug. 30, becoming the first Korean pop act to debut at No. 1. (Reuters)“ARMY had both incredible online impact and even financial power, shown in records and websites we’d broken, items we’d sold out and album sales,” said Erika Overton, 40, who convinced her 65-year-old mom to become a fan and helped found One in an ARMY, a charitable organization that rallied the ARMY to match BTS’s $1 million donation to Black Lives Matter. “I discovered their desire, like mine, to help these boys achieve success … the camaraderie and sense of family and friendship across all boundaries … and the incredible focus of power that happened when everyone focused on the same goal.”ADMobilized over social media, these fans are the ultimate hype crew for BTS, propelling the group to become a global brand, selling everything from its own line of Barbies to an SUV. And unlike many artists, BTS members own a stake in their label, Big Hit Entertainment, which went public in October with South Korea’s biggest stock offering in three years.The branding genius of K-pop band BTSLike other boy bands, BTS has the looks, the pipes and the style, but it was the group’s message that changed Murdock’s mind.AD“They seemed ‘real,’ discussed challenges, very unlike the rock bands of my past, where the lyrics were about getting drunk, fighting, playing hard,” said Murdock, who has since gone to two more of the group’s concerts with her daughter. “I did not know I was looking for it or even needed it, but it was refreshing. I have been depressed, I have suffered loss.”ADMurdock’s daughter Chelsea first found BTS while studying for graduate school exams. The band’s songs became her hype music and solace after her grandmother died.“Something about the intonation and the sort of desperation in [BTS member Suga’s] tone [in ‘First Love’], it just struck a chord with me,” said Chelsea, 31, who wrote about the song in a fan academic journal and is teaching a class incorporating BTS at Clemson University. “Without understanding the language, I still understood.”The name of the group also reflects the members’ character. BTS, which stands for Beyond the Scene, started off as an acronym for “Bangtan Sonyeondan,” which translates to “Bulletproof Boy Scouts,” and means to “block out stereotypes, criticisms and expectations,” explained member J-Hope in an interview on Korean radio when the band first debuted in 2013.ADADAnd while fans also applaud the band’s attitude, starting off as underdog at a smaller label, BTS did have the benefit of the label founder’s experience, explained Tamar Herman, who has been covering the group for Billboard Magazine since 2016. Big Hit Entertainment co-chief executive Bang Si-hyuk, known as “Hitman” Bang, was a composer for one of the biggest labels, JYP Entertainment. He worked with such artists as Rain, the first Korean to win an MTV award, and Wonder Girls, the first Korean group to enter the Billboard 100 chart.Initially, Big Hit’s other artists “didn’t have much luck,” Herman said, after its girl group Glam disbanded and members of its boy band 2AM left.“BTS was really their last shot and they kind of gave it their all,” said Herman, who recently released a book about BTS. “And because they were giving them their all, they were able to try some new things.”ADADSo instead of primarily appearing on South Korean television, like other K-pop groups, BTS tried out social media, chatting with fans on Twitter.BTS’s songs were not typical pop either. While the group started in hip-hop, their music encompassed different genres, Herman said, and incorporated a vision for the world to be a better place.“We started to hear remarkable stories from our fans all over the world, how our message helped them overcome their hardships in life and start loving themselves,” said BTS leader RM at the U.N. General Assembly in 2018, where they were campaigning for UNICEF to end violence against children. “These stories constantly remind us of our responsibility.”ADAnd fans of the group fully believe in the boy band’s message of hope. The ARMY has a saying: “You will find BTS when you need them the most.”AD“I was able to find comfort through their music during my dark days,” said Danielle Given Acido, a 20-year-old college student in the Philippines studying petroleum engineering. “They speak the words I cannot speak on my own. Compared to mainstream K-pop, their music conveys the reality of the pain of the youth and the struggles.”To better help each other, fans created an ARMY Help Center in 2018, a network of 150 trained volunteers across 40 countries willing to be a “shoulder to lean on, especially those who are from countries and cultures that still consider mental illness to be taboo,” said Asmae El Mansari, a 27-year-old administrator from Morocco. She estimates that the network has been able to help at least 30,000 people in the past few years.ADDuring the pandemic, ARMY has also been a lifesaver for fans.“Somehow there is an unwritten oath between us, ‘through thick and thin, we will go through things together,’ ” said Acido, who is also an administrator for BTS International, a fan community with nearly 260,000 followers on Twitter.This extended network helped another mother find joy during the pandemic. Candace Epps-Robertson, 42, also discovered BTS through her daughter, 14-year-old Phoenix. Epps-Robertson’s ARMY friends “kicked in support” with constant group chats and texts, which convinced the assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to devote a class to the “rhetoric of resistance” — how communities such as BTS and its ARMY affected Black Lives Matter. She’s also used the group’s lyrics to talk through issues with her daughter about dating and race.ADAD“When BTS spoke on BLM, it made me feel like they are recognizing me, and my community, and telling me that I matter to them,” said Phoenix, who is learning Korean to better understand songs. “I think we are connected by our desire to do good in a way that reflects this message.”K-pop's recognition of Black Lives MatterBecause fans feel like BTS has their back, they show the same support for the group. When an Australian pop culture show made fun of the group, the ARMY created a social campaign, prompting an apology.“It’s a little bit like a couple that has formed a love relationship,” said Murray Stein, a psychoanalyst, whose book, “Jung’s Map of the Soul” was the premise for BTS’s seventh album. “You say anything bad about the one I love? I’m going to have to go on the defensive.”Psychoanalytic principles are not usually in pop, Stein said, so he’s intrigued about the meaning behind BTS’s newest album, “Be.”AD“It’s almost a Buddhist state, just pure being,” Stein said. “Don’t worry about who you are, what you are, what you’re going to do next. Are you going to be successful or not? Just being. So maybe they’re moving in that direction.”As for the group’s immediate future, BTS’s biggest challenge may be the actual army. Ranging from 23 to 27, the members of BTS are subject to South Korean law, which says they must enlist for compulsory military service before turning 28. This could put their careers on hold for around two years.But fans are not worried.“I believe they have staying power,” Chelsea Murdock said. “I know that I’ll be there as long as they’re there, and even if they’re not active, I’m still going to be listening to their music.”Read more:The BTS effect: Making peace with my teenager through K-popChina went up against a K-pop giant — and lostKorean pop culture is everywhere.

       "4  [NEW YORK — Queen Bey is close to sitting on her Grammys throne: The singer won her 26th Grammy on Sunday, almost matching, and on track to surpass, Alison Krauss’ 27-win record.Beyoncé, this year’s leading contender with nine nominations, won two honors during the pre-ceremony including best rap performance for “Savage” with Megan Thee Stallion and best music video for “Brown Skin Girl.” She shares the latter with daughter Blue Ivy Carter, who is also having a historic night: At 9 years old, she’s the second youngest to win a Grammy.Support our journalism.

John Prine and Chick Corea both earned two wins posthumously.ADBillie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Dan + Shay, James Taylor, H.E.R., Beck, Brandi Carlile, Burna Boy, Tiffany Haddish and Rachel Maddow also won Grammys.While Beyoncé is set to have a historic night, history could repeat itself and she could be shut out of winning a top award — a common occurrence for R&amp;B and rap artists throughout Grammy history. Of her 26 wins, only one has been for one of the big four Grammys, song of the year. She has lost album of the year three times and record of the year five times.ADJay-Z has never won a top award, and he and his wife join a list of mostly Black performers who have been restricted to wins in the rap and R&amp;B categories, including Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West, Mariah Carey, Eminem, Drake, Missy Elliott, Mary J. Blige and more.This year The Weeknd was the one who was snubbed. Despite having the biggest hit of 2020 with “Blinding Lights” and a top-selling, multi-hit album, he didn’t earn any nominations. He’s won three Grammys so far — only in the R&amp;B categories — but he’s vowed to boycott the Grammys because he doesn’t agree with how the Recording Academy selects its winners.ADStill, Beyoncé and Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage” could become the second hip-hop song to win record of the year.ADTaylor Swift could make history too and become the first woman to win the show’s top prize, album of the year, three times. Her first surprise album of 2020 — the folky, alternative adventure “folklore” — is competing for the top honor, an award she first won in 2010 for “Fearless,” her breakthrough that helped establish her as a bona fide pop star even though she sang country music. She won again in 2016 for “1989,” her first full-length pop album that dominated the charts with a bounty of hits.Stevie Wonder, Frank Sinatra and Paul Simon are some of the male performers who have won album of the year three times. Producers or engineers have also won the award three times, including Phil Ramone, Ryan Tedder, David Foster, Bob Ludwig, Serban Ghenea and others. The only person to win the prize four times is mastering engineer Tom Coyne, who died in 2017.ADOther women who could make history Sunday include Megan Thee Stallion, who could also become the first female rapper to win best rap song. The Houston rapper, along with D Smoke, Chika and Doja Cat, could also become the fifth rap-based act to win best new artist. Their competition includes Kaytranada — who won two honors during the pre-ceremony — Phoebe Bridgers, Noah Cyrus and Ingrid Andress, who could become just the fourth act from country music to win.ADGrace Potter has the chance of being the first female performer to win best rock album in over two decades, and sister trio HAIM, the first all-female rock band nominated for album of the year.Though 84 awards will be handed out — roughly 10 during the live telecast — viewers are most likely watching for the performances.About two dozen acts will hit stages in downtown Los Angeles, including Swift, Bruno Mars, Cardi B, BTS, Billie Eilish, Harry Styles, Bad Bunny, Megan Thee Stallion, DaBaby, Dua Lipa, Post Malone, Chris Martin, Lil Baby, John Mayer, Maren Morris and Doja Cat.ADTrevor Noah will host the show, which will air on CBS and Paramount+. The Grammys were originally scheduled for Jan. 31 but were pushed back because of the coronavirus pandemic.ADArtists competing with Swift for album of the year include Coldplay, Post Malone, Dua Lipa, Jhené Aiko, HAIM, Black Pumas and Jacob Collier, who picked up a win during the pre-ceremony.___Follow AP’s complete coverage of the Grammys at www.apnews.com/GrammyAwardsCopyright 2021 The Associated Press.
